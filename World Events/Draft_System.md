# Draft System

📛 **NAME:** Draft System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** World Events / Roster Management  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** draft, roster, territory collapse, brand split, desperation, fantasy, cross-promotion, vultures  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Drafts are world-shaping emotional events, not just roster management tools. They simulate territory collapse, brand split survival, booking regime changes, desperation acts, and cross-promotional pacts. Drafts create permanent emotional scars, relationship fractures, and are moments of rebirth, theft, betrayal, and political warfare.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 5 draft types: Territory Collapse, Brand Split, Desperation, Fantasy, Cross-Promotion Pact
- 6 mechanic layers: Pick Order, Worker Willingness, Draft Memory, Stable Drift, Fanbase Drift, Identity Pressure
- 5 AI/Player strategies: Legacy Stacker, Future Builder, Culture Disruptor, Stability Drafter, Style War Drafter
- Draft fallout affects workers, fans, championships, and booking memory for years

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Very High (LLM can narrate draft drama, generate fallout stories, describe emotional consequences)

## Core Concept

In SCS, drafts are world-shaping emotional events, not just roster management tools.

They simulate moments of:
- Territory collapse
- Brand split survival
- Booking regime changes
- Desperation acts by struggling promotions
- Cross-promotional pacts gone wrong
- Fanbase realignment

**Drafts create permanent emotional scars and relationship fractures. They're moments of rebirth, theft, betrayal, and political warfare.**

## Draft Types ✅ LOCKED

| Type | Trigger | Emotional Context |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Territory Collapse Draft** | A territory dies or goes bankrupt | Surviving promotions descend like vultures. Workers emotionally re-anchor or drift depending on where they land. |
| **Brand Split Draft** | One promotion splits into multiple brands | Internal political fracture (kayfabe or real). Fan loyalty splits, stables are shattered, myth memory fractures. |
| **Desperation Draft** | A struggling promotion is granted first pick rights | Last-ditch survival attempt. Sparks resentment in stronger promotions and divides locker rooms. |
| **Fantasy Draft (Player/Scenario Mode)** | Player triggers hard reset or "What if?" mode | Great for starting fictional worlds. Forge founding myths based on early alignment decisions. |
| **Cross-Promotion Draft Pact** | Two companies agree to share talent pools | Mutual draft to create balance. Eventually breaks down when one side starts hoarding or sabotaging. |

**Each draft isn't just about who you pick. It's about what emotional war you just triggered.**

## Draft Mechanics ✅ LOCKED

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pick Order** | Based on scenario: worst-record first, coin toss, lottery draw, ego-driven bidding war |
| **Worker Willingness Flags** | Some workers resist draft picks if Loyalty, Traditionalism, or Morality conflicts exist |
| **Draft Memory** | How a worker was drafted affects their loyalty for years: Picked last = resentful. Passed over = bitter. Stolen = guilt-ridden or arrogant. |
| **Stable/Faction Drift** | If only part of a stable gets drafted, emotional loyalty webs fracture. Worker arcs shift. |
| **Fanbase Drift** | If a beloved homegrown talent is drafted away, emotional trust between promotion and fanbase can erode |
| **Promotion Identity Pressure** | If a promotion drafts a worker who doesn't fit their soul identity, they may be booed, buried, or emotionally exiled |

## Draft Strategies (AI + Player) ✅ LOCKED

| Strategy | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Legacy Stacker** | Drafts mythic veterans for prestige. Risks locker room decay or style mismatch. |
| **Future Builder** | Drafts young loyalty monsters. Builds slow-burn loyalty arcs. |
| **Culture Disruptor** | Intentionally drafts from hated rivals to fracture their myths (poison pick strategy). |
| **Stability Drafter** | Drafts based on backstage chemistry or locker room repair needs. |
| **Style War Drafter** | Drafts high aerialists to emotionally shift a grounded fed (or vice versa). |

**Draft isn't just "get the best worker." It's "what are you doing to your soul by choosing this person?"**

## Draft Fallout & Booking Memory Effects ✅ LOCKED

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Undrafted Worker Resentment** | Left behind? Treated as afterthought? Expect morale issues or late-stage rebellion arcs. |
| **Fan Nostalgia Anchors Break** | If beloved pairings are split, fans grieve, unless the arc justifies it emotionally. |
| **Early Betrayal Seeds Planted** | Many blood feuds are born from draft-era backstage stories ("I was picked because of you"). Decades later, they re-ignite. |
| **Championship Legacies Rerouted** | If a champion is drafted but the belt stays, title myth collapses unless booked carefully. |

---

## Real-World Inspirations

| Real Case | SCS Behavior |
|-----------|--------------|
| **2002 WWF Draft (Flair vs McMahon)** | Brand split as internal civil war. Big stars exiled to show dominance. Created artificial competition. |
| **Mid-'80s NWA Collapse / WWF Raids** | Territory death drafts. Emotional fan betrayal. Promotions collapsed from loyalty theft. |
| **Modern WWE Drafts (Brand shuffle)** | Fans see through the logic, emotional disconnect. Used in SCS as warning of drift if myth memory not respected. |
| **AEW/ROH Talent Blending (2022-24)** | Cross-promotional shared draft. Began collaborative, ended chaotic. World memory fractures if not managed with honesty. |

## Philosophy

> "Drafts in SCS are emotional earthquakes, not spreadsheets. They create fanbase drift, worker resentment arcs, promotion realignments, stables fractured, booking pressure ripple effects for years. Drafts don't just change the card. They change the soul of the entire wrestling world."

## Expanded Mechanics (Vol 5 lines 1082-1085) ✅ LOCKED

### Vulture Drafts (Territory Collapse) - Expanded

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Draft Pool** | All remaining contracted workers, staff, champions, and titles enter available pool |
| **Pick Order Logic** | Determined by regional proximity, power ranking, emotional loyalty flags (some feds refuse "tainted" names) |
| **Time Pressure** | Offers may be time-limited. Workers may disappear if not claimed fast. |
| **Worker Agency** | High Loyalty or Traditionalism = may refuse to report to a rival fed |
| **Title Myth Fallout** | If a belt is absorbed, it may collapse emotionally unless preserved properly |
| **Media Tone** | "Poachers." "Rebuilders." "Grave-dancers." Each fed's reputation shifts based on how they handle remains. |

**Real examples:** AJPW after NOAH exodus, WCW collapse into WWF, NWA territories folding in the '80s

### Desperation Drafts (Fed on Brink) - Expanded

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Drafted Workers' Reactions** | May resent going to sinking ship. May become saviour figures or bolt immediately. |
| **Fanbase Split** | Desperation drafting seen as cynical or heroic. Depends on soul fit. |
| **Post-Draft Fallout** | May trigger locker room friction or scandals if ego/workload spikes too fast |
| **Optional Restraints** | "Must only draft unsigned workers" / "Can only take 1 star from each rival" / "Can trade picks but not workers" |

**Real examples:** TNA begging for stars in 2005, early MLW rebuilding through scraps

### Brand Drafts (Split/Rebrand) - Expanded

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Protected List** | Each brand can lock in X number of talents before draft begins |
| **Unprotected Pool** | All other workers eligible. Players/AI must make hard emotional calls. |
| **Draft Style Options** | Classic round-by-round, "grab and hold," or randomized chaos |
| **Fan Reaction** | Depends on perceived integrity of split. Political = backlash. Earned (after stable wars) = support. |
| **Booking Pressure** | Belts may split, unify, or collapse depending on post-draft treatment |
| **Worker Memory** | "I wasn't protected." "They left me behind." Loyalty and morale shift instantly. |

Option to soft-split (division-based) or hard-split (full roster separation).

### Cross-Promotion Draft Pacts - Expanded

| Emotional Hook | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **False Alliances** | Draft creates power plays. Some workers turn this into backstage politics. |
| **Mid-Partnership Rivalries** | Friction may flare up during partnership |
| **Collapse Triggers** | Often collapses if ego/booking friction spikes. "We loaned you our ace, and you booked him to job?" |
| **Evolution Paths** | Can evolve into full mergers, invasions, or talent walkouts |

---

## Post-Collapse Talent Redistribution (Vol 5 lines 1086-1093) ✅ LOCKED

**Renamed from "Vulture Draft"** to avoid gamey feeling.

Also called: "Open Pool Frenzy," "Talent Grab Phase," "Soul Salvage Phase"

### Key Design Principles

- **OFF by default** (toggle on in setup or post-collapse world event options)
- NOT a formal draft, presented as chaotic industry scramble
- Media frame it as "blood-in-the-water moment," not organized event
- Handles collapse the way wrestling actually does: messily, politically, emotionally

### How It Works

| Mechanic | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Promotion collapses (financial ruin, scandal, internal revolt, soul death) |
| **Presentation** | "Following the collapse of PNW Pro, a free-for-all scramble has begun across the region." |
| **No Pick Order** | AI feds evaluate who to approach. Workers respond emotionally. Media react based on who "scavenged" vs "rescued." |
| **Worker Agency** | Some refuse to sign quickly (stunned, bitter, holding out). Others jump instantly. |
| **Title Handling** | Titles float, collapse, or vanish depending on treatment |

### Access Rules (Customizable)

- Only regional feds may claim talent
- Only promotions with scouting tags can see value in lesser-known talent
- First-come, first-served with negotiation skill and relationships mattering

### Optional Custom Triggers (Advanced Settings)

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Protect Belt Myths** | Major titles myth-locked unless transferred via worker with emotional legitimacy |
| **Enable Talent Grab Pressures** | Media criticize aggressive grabbing. Impacts fan loyalty or commentary tone. |
| **Chaos Clause** | Two+ feds after same worker triggers booking war or locker room poaching feud |
| **Full Draft Override** | Player can manually initiate structured redistribution draft, with backlash risk |
