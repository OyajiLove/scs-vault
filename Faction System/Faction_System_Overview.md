# Faction System

📛 **NAME:** Faction System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** World System / Booking System  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** faction, stable, group, nWo, bullet club, roles, leader, muscle, betrayal, bloat, growth  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Factions are emotional entities with defined roles, growth logic, and memory. They don't just break up randomly. Splits are earned, reactive, meaningful, and stored. AutoBooker books factions through the booker's brain, respecting role hierarchy, bloat risk, and fan sentiment.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 7 faction roles with distinct booking impacts
- Growth/contraction logic prevents bloat or stagnation
- 6 faction evolution types (split, regenerate, rebrand, clone, absorb, shadow decay)
- SCS Promise: factions never disappear randomly, breakups always create memory
- Booker archetype affects faction booking behavior

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Very High (LLM can narrate faction drama, explain power dynamics, generate betrayal storylines)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 1126-1135

## Core Concept

Factions are defined not just by who is in them, but by:
- **Why** those people are there
- **What** they represent emotionally
- **What purpose** they serve inside the group hierarchy
- **What story** the faction is meant to tell

Factions are emotional engines, not roster pages.

## Faction Roles ✅ LOCKED

| Role | Description | Booking Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Leader** | Symbol of the faction's soul | Loss, betrayal, or turn = identity crisis. Title target. Often closing segment focus. |
| **Lieutenant / Workhorse** | Ring general. Defends faction in matches. | May carry belts or take lead when leader won't. Stable emotional core. Betrayal from here feels earned. |
| **Mouthpiece / Politician** | Speaks, manipulates, sets agendas. May not be top worker. | Influences booking angles. May negotiate for faction, speak post-match. |
| **Enforcer / Muscle** | Scary presence. May not win titles. Exists to impose fear. | Booked in protection matches, big bump finishes, visual dominance. |
| **Protégé / Future** | Younger or "adopted" member meant to carry the torch. | Push potential. Fans track their growth. Betrayals from here = fire. |
| **Fodder / Loyal Cannon Fodder** | Low-tier ally used in tags, backstage angles, morale buffers. | They eat pins. They get jumped. They build sympathy (or mockery). |
| **Ghost / Shadow Ally** | Appears rarely. May be only partially aligned. | Adds mystique, tension, long-term betrayal angles. Often the surprise turn or ace in the hole. Long-term memory bomb. |

**Roles can change over time, but emotional memory sticks.**

**AutoBooker understands this. It doesn't just reshuffle names.**

## Faction Drift / Evolution Types ✅ LOCKED

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Split** | Faction divides into separate groups | Evolution → Legacy + solo Orton |
| **Regenerate** | Old faction revives with new purpose | New Blood vs Millionaire's Club |
| **Rebrand** | Same faction, new identity/era | Bullet Club era shifts |
| **Clone** | Splinter group mimics original | Young Lions → House of Torture |
| **Absorb** | One group swallows another | WWE buying ECW/Alliance-style angles |
| **Shadow Decay** | Becomes irrelevant but refuses to die | "Hey, remember Team Angle?" |

---

## SCS Promise: What Never Happens ✅ LOCKED

| TEW Behavior | SCS Rejection |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Faction disappears mid-week because someone got injured" | ❌ Never. Faction member losses = soft split, not automatic disband. |
| "New game starts, factions are gone by Show 2" | ❌ Not possible unless soul alignment breaks hard. |
| "Faction breaks up and no one references it again" | ❌ Faction betrayal = stored emotional memory, feud seed, and crowd reaction shift. |

**You'll never log in and find Bullet Club erased on a Tuesday.**

---

## Growth Logic: When to Expand ✅ LOCKED

| Trigger | AutoBooker Logic |
|---------|------------------|
| Faction is hot but has no fresh arcs | Add protégé, or introduce enforcer to spark new energy |
| Feud is asymmetrical | Add members to balance big stables in booking logic |
| New booking direction | Trend Rider or Fan Chaser bookers may add hot freelancers |
| Worker loyalty webs suggest it | Mentors may invite protégés in-world (memory supported) |

---

## Contraction Logic: When to Shrink ✅ LOCKED

| Trigger | AutoBooker Logic |
|---------|------------------|
| Faction is overrepresented on cards (match flavor saturation) | Booking memory sees crowd burnout, cool-down needed |
| Member redundancy | If multiple workers fill same match/card function, some become drift targets |
| Faction turns inward | Ghosting segments, no goals, no feuds = crowd tunes out |
| Worker push memory stagnates | If workhorse/lackey roles never evolve, push backlash may spark turn or walkout |

---

## Hold Steady Logic ✅ LOCKED

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Archetype balance is ideal | If faction has clear roles and isn't collapsing, AutoBooker holds course |
| Fan sentiment is positive | Crowd still loves them? No reason to touch it. |
| Feud structure is in progress | No implosions during Act 2. Pacing memory protects faction from chaos until it matters. |

**Bookers that expand too quickly? Bloat risk.**
**Bookers that refuse to evolve factions? Drift into irrelevance.**

---

## Booker Archetype Integration ✅ LOCKED

| Booker Archetype | Faction Behavior |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Heat Seeker** | Uses faction betrayals early. Will add/boot people fast for angle shock. |
| **Architect** | Builds factions with slow elevation. Doesn't collapse stables overnight. |
| **Reactionary** | May gut the faction after one bad rating or fan backlash. |
| **Politicker** | Keeps their allies close. May protect cliques from collapse. Subtle, simmering betrayals. |
| **Trend Rider** | Mimics whatever faction format is hot. Might bloat copycats. |
| **Burnout** | Neglects factions. May accidentally ruin their arcs or forget who's in. |
| **Survivor** | Uses factions to shield themselves. Protects enforcers. Uses lackeys as buffers. |
| **Company Man** | Uses factions cleanly but without strong heat. They exist. They may never matter. |

**AutoBooker books factions through the booker's brain, not a spreadsheet.**

---

## AI Booker Faction Considerations ✅ LOCKED

AutoBooker takes into account:
- Booker archetype (some push cliques, others hate 'em)
- Their history with each faction
- Fan emotional climate
- Myth memory (e.g., "Bullet Club hasn't mattered in 5 years" vs "LIJ is still godlike")
- Internal loyalty web (if the leader leaves, the group may collapse, but not immediately)

---

## World Integration ✅ LOCKED

| System | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| **Worker Resistance** | Faction members may refuse to be split, demand to remain aligned, or resist turns unless justified |
| **Fanbase Memory** | Breaking a beloved faction triggers backlash unless heat is paid off well |
| **Match Flavor (Vol. 4)** | Factions influence match structure (Chaos = chaotic tags, Blackpool Combat Club = gang beatdowns) |
| **Push Logic / Feud Memory** | Pushes built through factions retain memory if group breaks. Betrayals become arc pivots, not resets. |
| **Title Myth** | Some belts become tied to factions (Undisputed Era's NXT dominance). If faction dies, title may lose heat. |
| **Commentary & PR** | AutoBooker considers world reaction. "Why did they kill the biggest faction of 2024 out of nowhere?" Commentary might bury or spin it. |
| **Soul Fit** | Worker archetypes affect faction cohesion. Soul Purist in sleazy Heat Addict stable = eventual friction, world remembers explosion. |

## Faction Fracture & Evolution (Vol 5 lines 1137-1143) ✅ LOCKED

### Fracture Triggers

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Leadership Undermined** | Lieutenant/mouthpiece absorbs crowd attention, builds backstage support |
| **Booking Drift** | Faction's story stagnates or mismatches fed's soul |
| **Push Inequity** | One member winning too much, another sacrificed repeatedly |
| **Loyalty Web Tension** | New ally disrupts existing bonds |
| **Fanbase Drift** | Faction becomes stale, overpushed, bloated |
| **Ideological Schism** | Internal debate on style, ethos, purpose |
| **Real Scandal / Memory Drift** | External scandal/injury resets emotional center |

### Spinoff Faction Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Ideological Child** | Rejection of parent faction (Wolfpac to nWo, Bullet Club OGs vs Elite) |
| **Rebel Unit** | Workers defect to break leader's control (LIJ-style) |
| **Faction Within a Faction** | Clique becomes self-fulfilling prophecy (Evolution → Legacy, House of Torture within Bullet Club) |
| **Soul Preservers** | Founding members abandon corrupted version |

### When Faction CAN'T Fracture

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| **Single-soul group with no deviation** | Cannot split without external shock or turn |
| **Fan support too strong** | Breakup attempts cause resistance, even exiles get booed |
| **Leadership is myth-locked** | Followers stay loyal unless myth collapses |

**Protects Joshi factions, traditional dojo units, and sports-based trios from random TEW-style implosions.**

## Faction Identity Types (Vol 5 line 1144) ✅ LOCKED

Tags to prevent lazy AI assumptions about faction usage per promotion:

| Tag | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| **Soul-Aligned Faction System** | Factions are spiritual/ideological. Breakups = mythic. (Burning vs STERNNESS, WAVE) |
| **All-Faction World** | Everyone belongs to a group. Group feuds define booking rhythm. (NJPW, STARDOM, Dragon Gate) |
| **Faction-Lite World** | Some groups exist but not central to soul. (AEW, WWE mid-2000s, TNA) |
| **Crisis-Born Factions Only** | Factions emerge from betrayal/invasion only. (ECW, ROH pre-2016) |
| **Faction-Protected Booking** | AutoBooker avoids random faction movement unless story-driven |
| **Faction-Drift Permissive** | Factions may collapse/rebrand often. (nWo, House of Torture, Bullet Club 2010s) |
| **Faction-Less Booking Mandate** | Promotion resists factionalism. Joining/creating one = major arc. |

**Player & AI Can Set:**
- Faction Density Bias (few, balanced, faction-heavy)
- Faction Soul Importance (central or peripheral)
- Faction Drift Tolerance (tight ship or loose)

---

## Booking Instinct & Faction Timing (Vol 5 lines 1145-1151) ✅ LOCKED

| Instinct Tier | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|
| **0-4 (Chaotic Saboteur)** | Breaks factions randomly, adds/cuts without heat, ignores sentiment, kills momentum |
| **5-9 (Unstable Reactionary)** | Changes driven by backlash not story, misses turning points, betrayals land flat |
| **10-14 (Functional Craftsman)** | Can time good arcs but lacks subtlety, seeds visible/predictable, occasionally drags or rushes |
| **15-17 (Heat Sculptor)** | Reads crowd and locker room well, times additions/turns/spinoffs for max impact, knows when to hold |
| **18-20 (Mythmaker)** | Stretches tension over years, builds multiple diverging arcs, uses roles tactically, factions feel organic |

**Integration:** Even within same Booker Archetype, two AI bookers with different Instinct behave very differently. Two Heat Seekers: one high-instinct = CM Punk 2011, one low-instinct = Vince Russo late-WCW.
