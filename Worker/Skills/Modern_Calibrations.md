## FTR Analysis (Cash Wheeler vs Dax Harwood)

| Skill | Cash Wheeler | Dax Harwood |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Psychology | High (17-18) | High (16-17) |
| Selling | Extremely Good (18) | Very Good (16) |
| Fundamentals/Basics | Excellent (17-18) | Excellent (16-17) |
| Focus | Elite (18) | Good (14) |
| Adaptability | Excellent (17) | Decent (13) |
| Charisma | Lower (12) | Higher (15) |
| Mic Fluency | 12-13 | 13 |
| Believability | 16 | 15 |

**Key Insights:**
- Cash is the better true wrestler
- Cash has elite focus/concentration, orchestrates when things go wrong, adapts on fly
- Cash looks like Buzz Sawyer Jr (aesthetic)
- Cash is the glue who keeps FTR from derailing in messy matches
- Dax is the "face" of the team but Cash is the better in-ring worker
- Dax's promos overrated: stutters, brings up family/daughter constantly, rubs head
- "Tribute act" for Midnight Express is lame gimmick

**Archetype:** Enforcer/Technical Bruiser (both)

## Undertaker Reality Check (Prime: '97-'06)

| Skill | Rating | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Believability | 20 | Best attribute, undeniable |
| Charisma | 18 | Character work, aura |
| Brawling | 15 | Solid, not elite |
| Technical | 11 | Limited but functional |
| Psychology | 14 | Good, not great |
| Basics | 16-17 | Professional, smooth enough |
| Mic Fluency | 10 | Character carried it |
| Stamina | 15-16 | Decent for size |
| Selling | 13 | Serviceable |

**Reality Check Notes:**
- Old Man Taker is the most overrated era
- Many stinkers across all eras (Dudley Boys GAB worst ever, duds vs big guys on SmackDown)
- Opponent-dependent: couldn't carry bad workers
- Mythology power extremely strong (WWE booked career to inflate greatness)
- NOT GOAT-level wrestler or promo
- Great character, respectable long career, big aura
- Batista series was the one he truly carried (and Batista is underrated)
- HBK/HHH Mania matches feel masturbatory and overlong (especially HHH ones)
- Saudi match (bald HBK/HHH/Kane) was embarrassing

**Honest Assessment:** Great character, respectable career, but in-ring ability often overrated due to mythology.

## The Miz (Peak)

| Skill | Rating |
|-------|--------|
| Mic Fluency | 15-16 |
| Believability | 8-9 |
| Psychology | 13-14 |
| Basics | 9-11 |
| Charisma | 14 |
| Selling | 10-11 |

**Archetype:** Cowardly Heel (Pretender subtype)

**Notes:**
- "Too polished, not authentic" version of cowardly heel
- Polished, smooth even if hollow
- Very low believability: play actor tough guy
- Goofy expressions, overacting, lacks sincerity in selling
- Social media/narrative overhype distorts perception
- Pure facade: no real danger behind bluster, HAVE to cheat because not real threat
