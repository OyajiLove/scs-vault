## KEY PRINCIPLES

### What a 20 Looks Like

**The Rock (2000)** = Maximum calibration for Entertainment

| Attribute | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Charisma | 20 |
| Believability | 20 |
| Promo Skill | 20 |
| Menace | 15 |
| Sex Appeal | 20 |

A 20 is transcendent, era-defining. Not just "very good," but best-ever tier.

### Design Insights (Locked)

- **Charisma ≠ Flamboyance:** Bret, Misawa, Santo had quiet charisma
- **Menace Must Be Mythic:** Vader, Sid, Steiner need 19-20 Menace
- **Promo Skill ≠ Connection:** Sid, Steiner connected despite "bad" technical promos
- **Sex Appeal Is Market-Specific:** Bret huge with women, Vader 2, Rock 20

### Basics Calibration Reference

| Worker | Basics | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Arn Anderson | 20 | Gold standard fundamentals |
| Barry Windham | 20 | Perfect footwork and timing |
| Akira Hokuto | 12-13 | Gritty, unpolished, fit her character |
| The Miz | 9-11 | Polished presentation, hollow fundamentals |
| Ham and Egger | 1-6 | Barely trained, crash test dummies |

## USAGE

When creating or validating worker stats:

1. Find comparable worker in calibration files
2. Use as baseline, adjust for era/context
3. If unsure, err toward 10-14 range (solid but not exceptional)
4. Reserve 18-20 for truly legendary ability in that area
5. Don't be afraid of low scores (3-8) for genuine weaknesses
