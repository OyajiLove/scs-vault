## Design Insights

### Charisma ≠ Flamboyance

Quiet magnetism counts. Bret Hart's charisma was in his intensity and excellence, not flash. Misawa barely spoke but commanded attention through presence.

### Menace Must Be Mythic

For monster heels and intimidators, 19-20 Menace is non-negotiable:
- Vader: 20 (could genuinely hurt you, crowd knew it)
- Sid: 20 (psychotic aura, unpredictable)
- Steiner BPP: 19 (unhinged, volatile)

### Promo Skill ≠ Connection

Technical promo ability ≠ crowd connection:
- Sid: Promo 9, but electrifying presence
- Steiner: Promo 7, but iconic through chaos
- Misawa: Promo 7, but didn't need words

### Sex Appeal Is Market-Specific

- Bret Hart: Huge with women (16), under-discussed
- The Rock: Crossover universal (20)
- Vader: Menace > appeal (2)
- Lex Luger: Body over substance (18)

## Notes

- Promo skills can change dramatically (Bret: 8-9 early → 16 peak)
- Believability 20 is rare: complete audience buy-in to reality of character
- Sex Appeal 20 requires genuine crossover mainstream appeal
