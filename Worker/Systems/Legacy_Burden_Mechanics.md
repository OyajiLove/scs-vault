# Legacy Burden Mechanics for Workers

📛 **NAME:** Legacy Burden Mechanics for Workers  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker System / Psychology  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** legacy, burden, pressure, protege, myth, crushed, survivor, expectation, ghost  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how living workers carry the emotional weight of fallen eras. Direct protégé connections, promotion identity weight, fanbase expectations, and internal guilt/grief create hidden legacy pressure. Workers may protect the myth, rebel against it, be crushed by it, or forge new myths from its ashes. Hidden Legacy Pressure Meter tracks accumulating burden over time.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 4 burden causes (protégé connection, promotion weight, fan expectations, internal guilt)
- 4 burden types (Protector, Rebel, Crushed, Myth Forger)
- Hidden Legacy Pressure Meter accrues over time
- Worker emotional drift paths based on personality stats
- Legacy arc booking can heal or worsen burden

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (LLM could generate burden narratives, pressure-driven storylines, worker psychological profiles, legacy confrontation scenes)

## 1. BURDEN CAUSES (4 TRIGGERS)

| Cause | Description | Pressure Generation |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Direct Protégé Connection** | Trained by fallen legends, debuted during dying Golden Eras, emotional successors tied to mythic figures | HIGH (+3-5 per year) |
| **Promotion Identity Weight** | Workers representing promotions known for fallen styles or cultures, forced to embody or reinvent them under pressure | MEDIUM (+2-4 per year) |
| **Public Fanbase Expectations** | Fans project emotional loyalty onto new workers, demanding they "live up" to ghosts of the past | MEDIUM (+2-3 per year) |
| **Internal Worker Guilt/Grief** | Workers themselves feel internalized pressure to honor mentors, fallen eras, or styles. Pride, loyalty, resentment, or burnout. | VARIABLE (+1-5 based on personality) |

---

## 2. BURDEN TYPES (4 RESPONSES)

| Type | Emotional Effect | Career Trajectory |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Protector of Myth** | Emotionally dedicated to honoring legacy. Loyalty high, storytelling arcs reflect genuine reverence. | Stable but potentially limited by reverence |
| **Rebel Against Myth** | Emotionally exhausted by legacy weight. Chooses to redefine or burn old emotional ties. | High risk, high reward. Can forge new identity or alienate fans. |
| **Crushed By Myth** | Collapses under weight of expectations. Spiraling into morale decay, loyalty drift, career burnout. | Tragic trajectory without intervention |
| **Myth Forging Survivor** | Channels grief into new mythology. Becomes bridge between dead era and living future. | Most successful long-term path, but rare |

### Burden Type by Personality Combination

| Traditionalism | Drive | Loyalty | Likely Burden Type |
|----------------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| HIGH | HIGH | HIGH | Protector of Myth |
| HIGH | HIGH | LOW | Myth Forging Survivor |
| HIGH | LOW | HIGH | Crushed By Myth |
| LOW | HIGH | ANY | Rebel Against Myth |
| LOW | LOW | ANY | Crushed or Disengaged |

## 3. HIDDEN LEGACY PRESSURE METER

Workers accumulate hidden legacy pressure over time:

| Pressure Level | Score Range | Worker State |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Minimal** | 0-20 | Healthy awareness of legacy |
| **Moderate** | 21-40 | Noticeable weight, manageable |
| **Significant** | 41-60 | Regular stress, affecting performance |
| **Heavy** | 61-80 | Serious burden, intervention needed |
| **Critical** | 81-100 | Breaking point, crisis imminent |

### Pressure Accumulation

```
Annual_Pressure = Base_Connection_Pressure + 
                  (Fan_Expectation_Gap × 0.5) + 
                  (Failed_Tribute_Attempts × 3) - 
                  (Successful_Grief_Arcs × 5)
```

### Pressure Release Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Pressure Relief |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Successful Grief Arc** | -15 to -25 |
| **Public Legacy Acknowledgment** | -5 to -10 |
| **Booking Freedom** | -10 to -15 (rebellion path) |
| **Time Passage** | -2 per year (natural decay) |
| **Therapy/Support (if modeled)** | -5 to -10 |

---

## 4. FAN EXPECTATION PRESSURE

The bigger the emotional vacuum, the harsher expectations:

| Fallen Figure Tier | Expectation Pressure |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Immortal Icon** | EXTREME (+5 per year) |
| **Main Event Legend** | VERY HIGH (+4 per year) |
| **Beloved Upper-Midcarder** | HIGH (+3 per year) |
| **Cult Favorite** | MEDIUM (+2 per year) |
| **Regional/Niche Legend** | LOW (+1 per year) |

### Expectation Gap Calculation

```
Expectation_Gap = (Fallen_Figure_Mythological_Score - Worker_Current_Status) / 10

IF Expectation_Gap > 5: Pressure multiplier = 1.5x
IF Expectation_Gap > 8: Pressure multiplier = 2.0x
```

## 5. WORKER EMOTIONAL DRIFT PATHS

Based on hidden stats, workers drift toward different burden responses:

| Path | Trigger Conditions | Outcome |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| **Protector** | Traditionalism 70+, Loyalty 70+, Pressure < 60 | Stable reverence, limited ceiling |
| **Rebel** | Traditionalism < 50, Drive 70+, Pressure > 40 | Identity crisis, potential breakthrough |
| **Crushed** | Drive < 50, Pressure > 70, No intervention | Career decline, possible exit |
| **Myth Forger** | Drive 70+, Successful grief arc, Pressure managed | New mythology created |

### Drift Path Transitions

| From | To | Trigger |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Protector** | **Crushed** | Pressure exceeds 80, no relief |
| **Protector** | **Myth Forger** | Successful transcendent arc |
| **Rebel** | **Myth Forger** | Rebellion succeeds, creates new identity |
| **Rebel** | **Crushed** | Rebellion fails, fan rejection |
| **Crushed** | **Myth Forger** | Redemption arc (rare) |

## 6. LEGACY ARC BOOKING EFFECTS

Booking decisions affect legacy burden:

| Booking Decision | Burden Effect |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Tribute Match (sincere)** | -5 to -10 pressure |
| **Tribute Match (forced)** | +5 to +10 pressure |
| **Legacy Feud (won)** | -10 to -15 pressure |
| **Legacy Feud (lost)** | +5 to +15 pressure |
| **Championship with Legacy Weight** | +/- 10-20 depending on handling |
| **Freedom to Define Own Path** | -15 to -25 pressure |
| **Constant Legacy Comparisons** | +10 to +20 pressure |

---

## 7. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Worker | Legacy Burden |
|--------|---------------|
| **Go Shiozaki (NOAH Post-Misawa)** | Protector of Myth. Emotionally attached to preserving King's Road style and Misawa's legacy at personal career cost. Noble but limiting. |
| **Hangman Adam Page (AEW Post-Elite Era)** | Myth Forging Survivor. Forged new emotional mythology through failure, grief, and redemption arcs. Model success case. |
| **David Flair (WCW Late 90s)** | Crushed By Myth. Overwhelmed and miscast by being pushed into father's legacy spotlight prematurely. Never recovered. |
| **Charlotte Flair** | Mixed. Oscillates between Protector and Rebel. Legacy burden visible in booking and public discourse. |
| **Randy Orton** | Myth Forger (eventually). Early career Crushed tendencies, evolved into own legend. Long timeline. |

### David Flair Case Study

**Burden Source:** Ric Flair's legendary status

**Pressure Factors:**
- Immediate family connection (maximum)
- Same promotion (WCW late era)
- Physical/skill gap (enormous)
- Premature push (no development time)
- Public comparisons (constant)

**Burden Type:** Crushed By Myth

**Career Trajectory:**
- Initial push: pressure accumulation
- Fan rejection: pressure spike
- Repackaging attempts: failed
- Career decline: predictable result
- Legacy: cautionary tale

**Lesson:** Legacy burden without support or realistic expectations destroys careers. The system must model this.

## 9. PHILOSOPHY

> "You can wear the ghost's jacket, but unless you breathe new life into it, it becomes your coffin. Some workers are crushed by the weight of legends. Some spend their careers protecting shrines. Some burn it all down to find themselves. And a rare few channel the grief into something new, something that honors the dead while giving life to the future. The burden is real. How you carry it defines your legacy."

Legacy burden is one of the most psychologically complex systems in SCS. It's where wrestling's emotional history meets individual careers.
