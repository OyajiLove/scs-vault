# Worker Physical/Emotional Lingering System

📛 **NAME:** Worker Physical/Emotional Lingering System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker System / LMC Subsystem  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** scars, trauma, fatigue, wear, injuries, emotional, physical, lingering, career, aging  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Workers carry visible scars, chronic injuries, and emotional trauma across their careers. These lingering effects influence crowd reactions, match planning, road agent advice, and booking trust. Physical wear and emotional history are living factors in match planning and world memory, not just background stats.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 4 lingering categories: Physical Scars, Chronic Injuries, Emotional Trauma, Fatigue History
- Technical trackers: Scar Tissue, Chronic Injury, Emotional Linger Memory, Crowd Sensitivity
- Integrates directly with Living Match Context as Worker Fatigue/Wear layer
- Road Agents adjust advice based on worker state
- Crowds react differently to visibly worn-down workers
- Career arcs become messy emotional tapestries, not clean vertical lines

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Very High (LLM can describe visible damage, narrate career evolution, generate sympathy/exploitation reactions)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 881-885

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Living_Match_Context_System]] - Worker Fatigue/Wear is core LMC layer
- [[Road_Agent_Layer_System]] - agents adjust advice based on lingering
- [[Fanbase_Emotional_Climate]] - crowd sensitivity to damage
- [[World_Memory_Drift]] - scars become part of legend
- [[Worker_Morale]] - emotional fatigue affects morale

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact accumulation rates for scar tissue
- Recovery mechanics for different fatigue types
- How visible damage affects merchandise/popularity differently

## Core Concept

In real wrestling, workers carry scars, trauma, and emotional history visibly over time. These lingering effects influence:
- How crowds react to them
- How matches are planned
- How road agents advise pacing and escalation
- How booking trusts or hesitates to push them

Physical wear and emotional history are not just background stats. They are living factors in match planning, crowd memory, and career arcs.

## Lingering Categories ✅ LOCKED

| Type | Description | Gameplay Impact |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Physical Scars/Damage** | Scar tissue, visible injury markers, bandages, limps, stiff movement | Crowds respond to visible damage: sympathy, respect, or brutal exploitation |
| **Chronic Injuries** | Weak knees, neck issues, shoulder problems over time | Affects bumping, move sets, match pacing suggestions |
| **Emotional Trauma** | Betrayals, career-ending failures, serious injuries to friends/rivals | Crowd emotional memory triggers: sympathy, hatred, tragic nostalgia |
| **Fatigue History** | Long title reigns, brutal match stretches, wars survived | Workers slower, grittier. Crowd reactions shift toward awe or sorrow. |

## How Lingering Effects Are Created ✅ LOCKED

| Source | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Brutal Matches Survived** | Scar tissue, slower movement, aura of toughness or tragedy |
| **Chronic Working Through Injuries** | Mobility penalties, sympathy boosts from intelligent crowds |
| **Long-Term Emotional Arcs** | Worker becomes mythologized or tragically diminished in world memory |
| **Botched Betrayal Angles / Traumatic Turns** | Fans carry scars: boos, sympathy, myth drifts |

---

## Technical Trackers ✅ LOCKED

| System | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Scar Tissue Tracker** | After every brutal match, chance to accumulate visible damage markers |
| **Chronic Injury Tracker** | Workers who "work through" injuries without healing accumulate movement penalties |
| **Emotional Linger Memory** | Betrayals, title collapses, career tragedies logged as emotional scars |
| **Crowd Emotional Sensitivity** | Smarter fanbases (based on promotion world settings) respond more dramatically to visible lingering |

Lightweight data, heavy emotional impact.

## Worker Fatigue/Wear Types ✅ LOCKED

| Type | What Accumulates |
|------|------------------|
| **Physical Fatigue** | Tour exhaustion, cumulative injuries, decreased pacing resilience, limb-specific damage (knees, shoulders, neck) |
| **Mental/Emotional Fatigue** | Betrayal arcs, long championship reigns, backstage political wars, trauma from tragedies (e.g., peer deaths) |
| **Aura Fatigue** | Audience slowly starting to emotionally drift from an overexposed or exhausted worker (even if physically healthy) |

---

## Worker Evolution Example Timeline

| Year | Worker Emotional/Physical State |
|------|--------------------------------|
| Year 1 | Young lion: fresh, springy, clean look |
| Year 4 | First brutal blood feud: forehead scars appear, gait slightly stiffens |
| Year 7 | Betrayal angle: crowd memory now shades every major comeback with bittersweet tension |
| Year 9 | Chronic shoulder injury visible: fewer power moves, more desperation selling |
| Year 12 | Tragic retirement match opportunity: world memory weighted emotionally |

Their body and their soul tell their story now, not just stat sheets.

## Real-World Examples

| Worker | Visible Changes |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Post-War Veteran (e.g., Kawada)** | Slower pacing, grit selling, scarred forehead, fans roar for even small victories |
| **Emotional Traitor (e.g., Shawn Michaels 1997)** | Crowd volatile: love/hate reactions long after initial betrayal |
| **Hardcore Legend (e.g., Mick Foley)** | Visible limp, stiff falls, scar tissue: massive sympathy surges when taking beatings |
| **Overworked Champion (e.g., Okada 2017)** | Fans detect subtle exhaustion: hope for epic collapse or redemption |

---

## Practical Gameplay Impact ✅ LOCKED

| System | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Road Agents** | Suggest slower pacing, sympathy spots, grittier finishes based on worker state |
| **Match Ratings** | Matches that respect worker history can become more legendary |
| **Worker Morale** | Long-suffering workers with hidden low Morale may snap mid-career |
| **World Memory** | Fans mythologize scarred, traumatized workers differently than fresh athletic stars |

**Philosophy:** Respect the past, or the world will respect you less.

## LMC Integration

This system feeds directly into the Worker Fatigue/Wear layer of Living Match Context:

| Booking Layer | Fatigue Impact |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Road Agent Warnings** | "Boss, Worker A's knee isn't holding up well. Recommend slowing the heat segment and focusing on sympathy selling." |
| **Promotion Booking Bias** | Tendency to book battered workers into redemption arcs, tragic declines, heroic send-offs |
| **Match Flavor Bias** | Heavily fatigued workers naturally lean toward War, Tragedy, or Emotional Rollercoaster flavors |
| **Title Reign Memory Effects** | Long reigns ended by exhausted collapses remembered differently than quick losses |
| **Crowd Sympathy/Brutality Reactions** | Smart crowds surge emotionally seeing battered legends; bloodthirsty crowds sometimes exploit broken warriors |

---

## Philosophy

> "Workers in SCS carry visible and emotional history across their careers. Matches are not isolated mechanical affairs: they are built on bodies and scars and memories. Booking becomes a conversation with time, survival, and grief, not just star chasing."
