# Substance Abuse, Mortality, and Myth Systems

📛 **NAME:** Substance Abuse, Mortality, and Myth Systems  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker System / Health  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** substance, abuse, drugs, alcohol, mortality, death, myth, martyr, survivor  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how drug, alcohol, and reckless cultures impact wrestling memory. Outlaw hedonism increases mortality risk. Survivors carry emotional scars and guilt. Fallen workers become larger in death through martyrdom myths. Fan and worker romanticism reframes deaths as "burned too bright" while ignoring the horror.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 4 causes (hedonistic locker rooms, survivor guilt, tragic myth creation, cultural romanticism)
- 4 fallout forms (mortality surges, mythologized deaths, reputation decay, survivor drift)
- Mortality risk tracking by lifestyle factors
- Survivor guilt mechanics with loyalty adjustment
- Tragic myth creation for fallen workers
- Promotion mythology drift (cult status vs disgrace)

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (LLM could generate tribute narratives, survivor stories, myth reframing, cautionary tales)

## 1. IMPACT CAUSES (4 FACTORS)

| Cause | Description | Severity |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Outlaw Locker Room Hedonism** | Workers living fast and reckless. Physical toll and mortality risks skyrocket. | HIGH |
| **Survivor Guilt Cultures** | Survivors emotionally scarred by watching friends and mentors die early. Loyalty deepens but fractures silently. | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| **Tragic Myth Creation** | Fallen workers become emotionally larger in death. Martyrdom myths built around excess and fatal loyalty. | VARIABLE |
| **Cultural Drift into Romanticism** | Fans and surviving workers reframe dead workers romantically: "burned too bright," "true outlaws." Ignoring the horror. | MEDIUM |

---

## 2. SUBSTANCE ABUSE FALLOUT FORMS (4 TYPES)

| Fallout Type | Emotional Outcome |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Worker Mortality Surges** | Promotions suffer major emotional collapses as locker rooms die or physically break apart |
| **Mythologized Deaths** | Workers who die young or spectacularly (in-ring deaths, tragic overdoses) become emotional icons |
| **Promotion Emotional Reputation Decay** | Surviving promotions seen as negligent, cursed, or tragic depending on death handling |
| **Survivor Psychological Drift** | Workers become either fiercely loyal (guilt-driven) or emotionally hollowed and mercenary after mass mortality |

---

## 3. MORTALITY RISK FACTORS

| Factor | Risk Increase |
|--------|---------------|
| **Hedonistic locker room culture** | +30-50% |
| **Touring intensity (200+ dates/year)** | +20-30% |
| **Deathmatch/hardcore style** | +15-25% |
| **Financial instability** | +10-20% |
| **Isolation from family/support** | +15-25% |
| **Previous overdose** | +40-60% |
| **Mental health struggles** | +20-40% |

---

## 4. SURVIVOR GUILT MECHANICS

| Survivor Type | Emotional Effect |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Close friend of fallen** | -20 to -40 morale, +15-30 guilt meter |
| **Same locker room** | -10 to -20 morale, +10-20 guilt meter |
| **Same promotion (distant)** | -5 to -10 morale, +5-10 guilt meter |
| **Industry-wide (legend death)** | -5 morale industry-wide |

### Survivor Response Paths

| Response | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| **Channel into advocacy** | Positive arc potential, healing over time |
| **Suppress and continue** | Delayed breakdown risk |
| **Turn to same substances** | Cascading tragedy risk |
| **Leave industry** | Career ends but survival more likely |

### Survivor Loyalty Adjustment

After mortality events, survivor workers undergo emotional loyalty adjustment:
- **Increased Loyalty:** Guilt/grief bonding, staying to honor the fallen
- **Decreased Loyalty:** Survivor burnout/drift, need to escape the pain

---

## 5. TRAGIC MYTH CREATION

| Myth Type | Fan Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Martyrdom ("died for the business")** | Elevation to legendary status, flaws forgiven |
| **Cautionary Tale ("warning to others")** | Respect but less romantic attachment |
| **Romantic Tragedy ("burned too bright")** | Intense emotional attachment, flaws romanticized |
| **Forgotten Tragedy ("just another death")** | Minimal lasting impact |

### Promotion Mythology Drift

After mortality events, promotions drift toward:
- **Tragic Outlaw Cult Status:** Romanticized collapse, loyalty from hardcore fans
- **Scandalous Disgrace:** Cynical memory erosion, blamed for deaths

---

## 6. SIMULATION MECHANICS

| Mechanic | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Substance Culture Drift** | Promotions with hedonistic locker rooms accumulate hidden substance abuse risk stats, growing mortality risks over time |
| **Death Events** | If mortality events happen (in-ring deaths, overdoses), world memory anchors dead workers permanently, strengthening emotional myth |
| **Survivor Loyalty Adjustment** | Survivor workers undergo emotional loyalty adjustment: increased (guilt/grief bonding) or decreased (survivor burnout/drift) |
| **Promotion Mythology Drift** | Promotions either gain tragic outlaw cult status (romanticized collapse) or scandalous disgrace (cynical memory erosion) |

---

## 7. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Worker/Event | Substance and Myth Outcome |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| **FMW Locker Room** | Heavy deaths/ruin. Onita's legacy preserved romantically despite chaos. |
| **ECW Mortality Fallout** | Massive emotional scars. Many surviving ECW loyalists emotionally fractured; deaths romanticized or mourned bitterly. |
| **WWE Wellness Scandal Era** | Massive corporate loyalty decay. Cold reforms clashed with emotional mythologizing of Attitude Era excess. |

## 9. PHILOSOPHY

> "Outlaw locker rooms create loyalty through shared struggle. But when the struggle becomes self-destruction, loyalty can't save you. Survivors carry guilt that never fully heals. Fans romanticize deaths into myths, turning horror into poetry. 'They burned too bright.' 'True outlaws.' Beautiful words hiding ugly truths. SCS models this because it's real, and pretending it isn't would be a lie."

This system handles sensitive content with care while acknowledging wrestling's difficult history.
