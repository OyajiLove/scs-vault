# HIDDEN PERSONALITY TRAITS SYSTEM

📛 **NAME:** Hidden Personality Traits  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker Memory, Relationships & Behavior  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** ego, pride, paranoia, loyalty, trust, drive, morality, traditionalism, behavioral flags  
📝 **SUMMARY:**

Each wrestler carries hidden personality values (1-20) that inform their emotional responses, booking compliance, loyalty, and backstage behavior. These traits evolve slowly and power emergent conflict and storyline logic.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Each worker starts with hidden values for Ego, Loyalty, Morality, Traditionalism, Paranoia, Drive, Risk-Taking, Resilience (and potentially more)
- These traits influence reactions to booking (e.g. a paranoid worker may interpret a loss as sabotage)
- Personality mismatches cause heat between wrestlers or between wrestler and management
- Traits can change over time, especially after major career events (injuries, betrayals, title wins/losses)
- Workers are assigned 1-2 personality archetypes that set suggested ranges for these traits
- Archetypes are revealed through emergent behavior, not listed visibly to player

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes: behind-the-scenes dialogue, promo tone, long-term character memory, decision-making in emergent events

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol. 1 (foundation), Vol. 3 (12 core archetypes locked), Vol. 4 (expanded to 17+ with stat ranges)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** [[Archetypes/_Archetypes_Index|Archetypes]], Relationships & Tension, Morale, Backstage Politics, Power Struggles, [[Turn_Engine]], Contract Negotiations, Emergent Story Events

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**

- Do traits affect a worker's capacity for redemption arcs or heel/face believability?
- How quickly do traits change after major events? (Linear drift vs. sharp shifts?)
- Can archetypes mutate over career (e.g., Chronic Underdog → Fading Star)?

✅ **STATUS:** LOCKED (Vol 4 for core system + archetypes)

### Additional Hidden Traits (#158-159)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #158-159

#### Coachability (#158)

| Trait | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Coachability** | How well a worker listens, learns, absorbs training | Training improvement rate, skill development |

**Distinct from Drive:** Coachability measures receptiveness to instruction, not self-motivation.

Key Quote: "Some workers train, listen, learn. Some don't."

| Profile | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| High Drive + High Coachability | Rapid improvement: seeks training AND absorbs it |
| High Drive + Low Coachability | Works hard but repeats mistakes, stubborn |
| Low Drive + High Coachability | Can improve if pushed by others, won't seek it out |
| Low Drive + Low Coachability | Stagnates, resists change |

#### "Needs Rub" Hidden Flag (#159)

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Needs Rub** | Hidden flag marking workers who specifically need a big opponent to elevate them |

**Triggers:**
- When matched with established stars, Rub Mechanics activate
- DDP needed Savage; Kawada needed Misawa
- Some workers can self-elevate; others require external help

**Career Impact:**
- Workers with this flag may stall indefinitely without proper booking
- Smart bookers identify and provide rub opportunities
- Without rub, worker hits invisible ceiling regardless of skill

---

## DRIVE/GOAL SHIFT SYSTEM (#38)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #38, #68-70

### Core Concept

"Once goals are met (titles, respect, money), motivations mutate."

### Drive Attribute Effects

| Drive Level | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| High Drive (16-20) | Constantly improves, seeks opportunities, fights through setbacks |
| Moderate Drive (10-15) | Plateaus at realistic level unless incentivized |
| Low Drive (6-9) | Coasts after fame, mentally checks out |
| Very Low Drive (1-5) | Collapses under success, "could have been" guys |

### Goal Shift Mechanics

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|----------|
| Chase dream achieved | May shift to "coast and vibe" mode |
| Post-title win, low Drive | Matches become shorter, safer, lazier |
| Major injury forces reinvention | Can trigger style shift (Onita, Danielson) |
| Intervention (new challenge, heel turn) | Can revive motivation |

### Example: Nakamura (Locked)

- Wins top title
- Drive stat naturally declines post-achievement
- Matches become shorter, safer, lazier
- Fans slowly feel it: "Nakamura still has star aura, but matches aren't what they used to be."
- Without intervention, coasts and fades from top draws

### Effort Visibility

Crowd and locker room can tell if worker is "mailing it in":
- Fans get restless over time
- Locker room loses respect
- Agents note it in reports

### Self-Driven Growth Traits (#68)

| Trait | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| Drive | How determined to improve, even when "good enough" |
| Self-Awareness | How accurately they judge own strengths/weaknesses |
| Adaptability | Willingness to shift style, learn new skills, take risks |
| Ego | How much they refuse help or constructive criticism |

### Growth Scenarios

| Profile | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| High Drive, High Self-Awareness, High Adaptability, Modest Ego | Actively seeks training, naturally improves skill gaps (Omega, late 90s Kawada) |
| High Drive, Low Self-Awareness, High Ego | Thinks they're better than they are, doesn't address real weaknesses |
| Low Drive, High Ego | Coasts on reputation, resents criticism |

### Events That Influence Growth (or Decay)

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Major Loss/Embarrassment | Humbling can spark real growth if worker has adaptability |
| Serious Injury | Some accept decline; some reinvent (Onita, Danielson) |
| Major Feud Against Superior Opponent | High-Drive workers use feud to grow; low-Drive workers coast and get exposed |

---

## MONSTER AURA GENERATION (#42)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #42

### Threshold System

| Requirement | Condition |
|-------------|----------|
| Menace | 16/20 or higher (core driver) |
| Size/Power | Not laughably low (unless "crazy unhinged" aura gimmick) |
| Charisma/Believability | Moderate support (no credibility = no fear) |

### Generation Method

- **Auto-generated:** Based on stats meeting threshold
- **OR weighted chance:** If backstory/tags compensate (e.g., "Deathmatch Sicko" overrides low size)

### Dynamic Evolution

- Worker bulks up, works stiffer → gains Monster Aura over time
- Worker loses size, gets exposed → loses Monster Aura over time
- Not a permanent state, can be earned or lost

---

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Data Structure

```json
{
  "worker_id": "worker_12345",
  "hidden_personality": {
    "traits": {
      "ego": 16,
      "loyalty": 8,
      "morality": 14,
      "traditionalism": 12,
      "paranoia": 11,
      "drive": 18,
      "risk_taking": 14,
      "resilience": 16
    },
    "archetypes": {

      "secondary": "Mercenary Soul"
    },
    "trait_history": [
      {"date": "2024-03", "trait": "ego", "change": +3, "trigger": "title_win"},
      {"date": "2024-06", "trait": "loyalty", "change": -4, "trigger": "contract_dispute"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### Trait Change Frequency

- **Slow drift:** ±1 per year naturally
- **Event-triggered:** Immediate shifts based on career moments
- **Archetype mutation:** Rare, only after multiple aligned trait shifts

### Balancing

- Extreme traits (1-5, 16-20) should be **rare** in generated workers
- Most workers should cluster 8-14 (functional but flawed)
- Legends and problem children live at extremes

---

## WORKER REFUSAL/RESISTANCE MECHANICS (#44)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #44

### Core Concept

Workers aren't chess pieces. They have opinions about their booking and will resist decisions they find unacceptable based on their personality traits.

### Resistance Examples

| Resistance Type | Example | Trigger |
|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **Job Resistance** | "Austin refuses to job clean under 15 minutes unless morale is 90+" | Low Ego threshold crossed |
| **Turn Resistance** | How hard a worker fights alignment changes | Traditionalism + Loyalty |
| **Push Resistance** | How workers resist being pushed down | Ego + Paranoia |
| **Internal Resistance Threshold** | When crossed, triggers events without player control | Multiple traits |

### Gimmick Pressure System

Workers trapped in wrong gimmicks actively push for change:

| Worker Satisfaction | Behavior |
|---------------------|----------|
| Happy with gimmick | Performs at peak |
| Tolerable gimmick | Slight performance dip |
| Unhappy with gimmick | Demands change, morale drops |
| Hates gimmick | Threatens to leave, sabotages performance |

**Example:** "Steve Austin hates Ringmaster, demands change."

**Resolution Options:**
- Grant gimmick change
- Explain reasoning (may or may not accept)
- Refuse (risk losing worker or poor performance)

### Creative Control

Top stars negotiate for title shots, creative control, money. Uses leverage based on overness:

| Overness Level | Leverage |
|----------------|----------|
| Megastar (90+) | Can demand almost anything |
| Main Eventer (75-89) | Significant negotiating power |
| Upper Midcard (60-74) | Some influence |
| Midcard and below | Take what you're given |

---

## DRIVE / GOAL SHIFT SYSTEM (#38, #116)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #38, #116

### Core Concept

Once major career goals are achieved (titles, respect, money), motivations mutate. Workers don't stay hungry forever.

### Drive Attribute Effects

| Drive Level | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **High Drive** | Constantly improves, seeks opportunities, fights through setbacks |
| **Moderate Drive** | Plateaus at realistic level unless incentivized |
| **Low Drive** | Coasts after fame, mentally checks out |
| **Very Low Drive** | Collapses under success, "could have been" guys |

### Goal Shift Mechanic

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|----------|
| Chase dream achieved | May shift to "coast and vibe" mode |
| Post-title win, low Drive | Matches become shorter, safer, lazier |
| Intervention (new challenge, heel turn) | Can revive motivation |

### Post-Achievement Possibilities

| Pre-Achievement Goal | Post-Achievement Outcomes |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| "I want to be champion" | Coast, seek new challenge, mentor role, leave |
| "I want to main event" | Protect spot, help others, or check out |
| "I want respect" | Satisfied or become bitter if not given |
| "I want money" | May leave for bigger offer regardless of loyalty |

### The Nakamura Example (Locked)

> Worker wins top title → Drive stat naturally declines → Matches become shorter, safer, lazier → Fans slowly feel it: "Nakamura still has star aura, but matches aren't what they used to be." → Without intervention, coasts and fades from top draws.

### Effort Visibility

Crowd and locker room can tell if worker is "mailing it in":
- Fans get restless over time
- Road agents note declining effort
- Match quality metrics expose the drift
- Locker room respect may drop

---

## WORKER COASTING / MAIL IT IN MODE (#117)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #117

### Core Concept

Workers with met goals and low Drive begin coasting. This isn't laziness per se, but the absence of fire that once drove them.

### Coasting Symptoms

| Indicator | Detection Method |
|-----------|------------------|
| Shorter matches | Match length decreases vs. historical average |
| Safer style | Fewer big bumps, less risk-taking |
| Reduced effort | Match quality dips |
| Phoning it in | Crowd senses lack of fire |

### Trigger Conditions

- Post-title run + Low Drive + No new challenge
- Major goal achieved + Drive naturally declining
- Injury recovery + lost hunger
- Contract security + no motivation

### Detection Methods

- Match quality metrics declining
- Road agent reports noting lack of effort
- Crowd reactions becoming tepid
- Locker room gossip about "checked out" worker

### Recovery Paths

| Intervention | Success Rate |
|--------------|-------------|
| New rival | High (competition revives fire) |
| Heel turn | Moderate-High (reinvention) |
| Reinvention angle | Moderate (if willing to change) |
| Contract ultimatum | Low (may just leave) |
| Personal crisis | Variable (can break or remake) |

---

## OUTSIDE INTERESTS / PERSONAL PRIORITIES (#160)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #160

### Core Concept

Workers have non-wrestling passions that compete with career focus. Some wrestlers simply love something else more than wrestling.

### The Sid Vicious Principle

**Key Quote:** "Sid loved softball and would legit just fuck off and play softball and not wrestle sometimes."

### System Mechanics

| Outside Interest Level | Effect |
|------------------------|--------|
| Minimal | No impact, wrestling is life |
| Moderate | Occasional conflicts, manageable |
| High | Regular no-shows unless heavily incentivized |
| Obsessive | Wrestling is side gig, not career |

### Promotion Responses

| Approach | Outcome |
|----------|--------|
| Tolerate | Keep star, accept absences |
| Penalize | Risk losing worker, build resentment |
| Accommodate | Work around schedule, maintain relationship |
| Ultimatum | Force choice, may backfire |

### Fan Perception

| Scenario | Fan Response |
|----------|-------------|
| Worker stays over despite absences | Fans find it charming (cult status) |
| Momentum drops during absences | Backlash, "doesn't care about us" |
| Absences hurt major storylines | Nuclear heat, may never recover |

### Historical Examples

| Worker | Outside Interest | Impact |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Sid Vicious | Softball | Notorious absences, "half the brain" meme |
| Brock Lesnar | Hunting, UFC | Left wrestling multiple times |
| The Rock | Acting | Transitioned entirely, returns only |
| Various | Acting careers | Reduced schedules, eventual departure |

---

## SHOOT FIGHTING ABILITY / BACKSTAGE PRESENCE (#171)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #171

### Core Concept

Separate backstage attribute distinct from kayfabe Physical stats. Some workers can legit scrap; this affects backstage dynamics, not match quality.

### Backstage-Only Attributes

| Stat | What It Captures |
|------|------------------|
| **Shoot Fighting Ability** | Ability to handle yourself if chaos breaks out |
| **Locker Room Presence** | Level of respect/fear/admiration from peers |
| **Temperament** | Likelihood to start fights, hold grudges |
| **Professionalism** | Willingness to work safely, show up, play ball |

### Triggers for Shoot Fighting

| Event | How Shoot Ability Matters |
|-------|-------------------------|
| **Brawl for All type events** | Shoot ability determines actual outcomes |
| **Breaking up backstage fights** | Strong scrapper = stops faster |
| **"No one messes with him" rep** | Protects from bullying/burial attempts |
| **Worker intimidation angles** | Shoot rep lends authenticity |

### Why Separate From Kayfabe Stats

**Key Insight:** Haku could rip your face off but wasn't a cardio machine in ring. Bart Gunn won Brawl for All but was nothing special in kayfabe.

| Worker | Kayfabe Physical | Shoot Ability | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| Haku | Moderate | Legendary | "Legitimate most dangerous man in wrestling" |
| Bart Gunn | Moderate | High | Won Brawl for All, still midcarder |
| Brock Lesnar | Elite | Elite | Rare convergence |
| Rey Mysterio | High (agility) | Low | Size matters in shoots |
| Ken Shamrock | High | Elite | UFC background |

### Locker Room Effects

| Shoot Rep | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Legendary** | Nobody crosses them, instant respect |
| **High** | Given wide berth, benefits of doubt |
| **Moderate** | Normal backstage politics apply |
| **Low** | May be target for bullying if unpopular |
