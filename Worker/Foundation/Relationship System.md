The Relationship System tracks the complex web of interpersonal connections between workers. Relationships evolve over time, affect booking decisions, influence morale, and create emergent drama. From family bonds to bitter rivalries, from mentor-protege dynamics to romantic complications, this system makes the wrestling world feel alive with human connections.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Every worker has a relationship web of connections to other workers
- Relationships have types, strength levels, and temporal evolution
- Relationships affect morale, booking chemistry, faction dynamics
