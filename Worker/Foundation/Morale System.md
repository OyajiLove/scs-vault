# Morale System

📛 **SYSTEM:** Worker Morale
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker Simulation / Mental State
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** morale, happiness, satisfaction, motivation, burnout, mental state
📝 **SUMMARY:** Tracks worker mental state and job satisfaction. Currently conceptual: morale effects are distributed across Hidden Personality (Drive, Ego), Contract System (satisfaction), and Injury System (mental impact).

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Worker morale affects performance, contract negotiations, and loyalty
- High morale = better matches, more cooperative
- Low morale = worse performance, flight risk, potential no-shows
- Morale influenced by: booking decisions, contract satisfaction, injuries, faction dynamics

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal

📌 **ORIGIN:** Referenced throughout Vol 1-4, never formalized as standalone

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Hidden_Personality]] (Drive and Ego interact with morale)
- [[Contract System]] (Contract satisfaction is de facto morale tracking)
- [[Injury System]] (Injuries affect mental state)
- [[Faction System]] (Faction health affects member morale)
- [[Backstage Politics System/_Backstage Politics System Index|Backstage Politics]] (Political outcomes affect morale)

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Should this be a standalone system or remain distributed?
- Exact morale score calculation
- Morale decay/recovery rates
- Visible vs hidden morale tracking

✅ **STATUS:** Conceptual (distributed across other systems)

## Design Note

Morale is currently **implicit** rather than explicit. It's expressed through:

1. **Hidden Personality:** Drive affects motivation, Ego affects demands
2. **Contract System:** Contract satisfaction = de facto morale
3. **Injury System:** Physical state affects mental state
4. **Faction System:** Faction stability affects member morale

A standalone Morale System could consolidate these, but may create redundancy.
