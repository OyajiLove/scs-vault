# MAJOR EVENT INFLECTION SYSTEM

📛 **NAME:** Major Event Inflection System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Federation Management / Crisis  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** scandal, inflection, DNA reset, crisis response, narrative architecture  
📝 **SUMMARY:**

Not every scandal burns you. Not every walkout ends your fed. Sometimes the wrong move becomes the right character turn. This system handles major real-world-style events that can reshape your promotion's DNA overnight, based on how you respond.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Inflection events trigger when something goes "too real" or "too viral"
- Player response determines whether event destroys or transforms the promotion
- Successful inflections can birth new eras
- Response options range from acknowledgment to exploitation to denial
- Montreal Screwjob is the canonical example

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (response generation, narrative framing, era naming)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 3 lines 296-300

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Company_DNA_Evolution]] - Inflections cause DNA hard resets
- [[Era_Markers_Legacy_Milestones]] - Successful inflections create era boundaries
- [[Scandal System]] - Feeds into inflection triggers
- [[Media System]] - Media response affects inflection outcomes

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Can players intentionally trigger inflections?
- Multiple simultaneous inflections?
- Long-term inflection memory decay?

✅ **STATUS:** 🔒 LOCKED

## INFLECTION EVENTS (TRIGGERING CATALYSTS)

Moments where something goes too real or too viral to ignore:

| Event | Potential Result |
|-------|------------------|
| **Public fallout with top star** (Bret, Punk, etc.) | May destroy morale... or turn you into a heel boss character |
| **Worked shoot goes off rails** | Fans may revolt or crown the speaker a cult hero |
| **Network complaint about a segment** | May force tone shift... or give you a reputation for edginess |
| **Major injury used in angle** | Risk backlash... or become a legendary revenge arc |
| **Union busting leak** | May burn trust... or draw in anti-union sponsors who love the ruthlessness |
| **Face turns on fans in real life interview** | Heel alignment "sticks" and changes show tone |
| **Booker caught leaking or sabotaging** | May create factional war, and a compelling storyline if embraced |

## CANONICAL EXAMPLE: MONTREAL SCREWJOB

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Scandal** | Public fallout with top star + exposed finish |
| **Fan Reaction** | Betrayal + outrage |
| **WWF Response** | Vince leans in, turns heat into heel persona |
| **Outcome** | New DNA era born. Attitude was no longer "coming." It was here. |

**In SCS, this is what separates reactive players from narrative architects.**

## INFLECTION RESPONSE OPTIONS

| Option | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Acknowledge & Incorporate** | DNA shifts toward reality fusion, fans get hooked |
| **Deny & Sanitize** | May avoid short-term loss, but fans may rebel |
| **Exploit Boldly** | Sponsorship risk skyrockets, but buzz soars |
| **Overcorrect** | Tone flattens. Risk of crowd disconnect. |
| **Let Others Tell the Story** (podcasts, dirt sheets) | Identity begins evolving without your consent |

## DNA & INFLECTION: PERMANENT SHIFT

If an inflection is:
- Successful
- Embraced
- Or inescapable

It may result in a hard reset or new era tag:

**Example Era Names:**
- "SCS enters the Chaos Era."
- "SCS: The Red Thread Years"
- "Post-Split Reconstruction"
- "No Heroes Left Tour (2025-)"
- "Golden Gate Car-Crash Era"

**This changes:**
- How the world describes your fed
- How new talent views working there
- How fans chant, meme, and remember you
- Which agents stick around, and who resigns
