## Overview

What happens when a promotion continues using a worker AFTER a scandal is exposed and they stay anyway?

**Core Truth:** Keeping toxic workers has cascading consequences that go far beyond the initial scandal.

---

## Core Fallout Categories

| Fallout Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Sponsor Loss Risk** | Major sponsors quietly or loudly pull funding |
| **TV Deal Risk** | Networks pressure firing or threaten cancellation/demotion |
| **Fan Engagement Decline** | Social media, merch, tickets shrink (not always immediately) |
| **Locker Room Morale Collapse** | Workers disgusted with enablement |
| **Political Splintering** | Locker room fractures into defending/opposing cliques |
| **Talent Exodus Risk** | Whistleblowers, young talent, marginalized workers ask out |
| **Cumulative Decay** | Multiple toxic workers = "toxic brand" reputation |

---

## Sponsor Loss Risk

| Factor | Sponsor Behavior |
|--------|------------------|
| **Scandal Severity** | Career-killers = immediate sponsor review |
| **Public Awareness** | Underground rumors = minimal risk; viral scandal = high risk |
| **Sponsor Type** | Family brands (Disney, Mattel) = zero tolerance; edgy brands = higher tolerance |
| **Era** | Pre-internet = sponsors mostly unaware; modern = instant pressure campaigns |

### Sponsor Response Timeline

| Timeline | Sponsor Action |
|----------|----------------|
| **Week 1** | Internal review, monitor situation |
| **Month 1** | Private pressure on promotion |
| **Month 3** | Public distancing or quiet exit |
| **Month 6+** | Permanent pullout if scandal unresolved |

---

## TV Deal Risk

| Scenario | Network Response |
|----------|------------------|
| **Minor Scandal** | Warning, request to address |
| **Major Scandal (Shielded)** | Reduced prominence, worse time slots |
| **Major Scandal (Unaddressed)** | Contract non-renewal risk |
| **Career-Killer Scandal** | Immediate contract review, possible cancellation |

### Era Effect on TV Pressure

| Era | TV Network Behavior |
|-----|---------------------|
| **1970s-1980s** | Networks rarely care about wrestling scandals |
| **1990s** | Growing awareness, some pressure |
| **2000s** | Significant pressure, public image matters |
| **2010s+** | Immediate pressure, social media campaigns against networks |

---

## Fan Engagement Decline

Not always immediate, but measurable over time:

| Metric | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Social Media Engagement** | Drops as fans distance themselves |
| **Merchandise Sales** | Toxic worker's merch tanks; promotion merch may decline |
| **Ticket Sales** | Some markets affected more than others (see [[Fanbase DNA System]]) |
| **Viewership** | Slow decline as word spreads |

### Fan Segment Responses

| Fan Type | Response to Toxic Worker Retention |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Hardcore Loyalists** | Often defend promotion |
| **Family-Friendly** | Immediate rejection if children-unsafe scandal |
| **Indie Hardcore** | Fast backlash, "hypocrite" accusations |
| **Casual Mainstream** | Follow media narrative |
| **Women/Marginalized** | Fastest to leave if harassment/discrimination |

---

## Locker Room Morale Collapse

| Worker Type | Response to Toxic Worker Retention |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Political Allies** | Defend, protect, justify |
| **Principled Workers** | Request releases, leak information |
| **Vulnerable Workers** | Fear speaking up, morale tanks silently |
| **Opportunists** | Use situation to advance own position |

### Morale Impact by Scandal Type

| Scandal Type | Morale Impact |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Substance Abuse** | Moderate (often sympathized with) |
| **Racism** | Severe (divides locker room racially) |
| **Sexual Harassment** | Severe (women workers flee or fear) |
| **Violence** | High (workers fear for safety) |
| **Financial Crimes** | Moderate-High (trust in management destroyed) |

---

## Political Splintering

Locker room fractures into factions:

| Faction | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Defenders** | Rally around toxic worker; attack critics |
| **Critics** | Demand action; may leak to media |
| **Silent Sufferers** | Stay quiet but morale destroyed |
| **Opportunists** | Exploit chaos for career advancement |

### Faction Formation Factors

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Toxic Worker's Star Power** | More power = more defenders |
| **Management's Response** | Dirty Loyalty = defenders protected; Clean Hands = critics empowered |
| **Era** | Modern era = more critics willing to speak |
| **Previous Political Landscape** | Existing factions may realign around scandal |

---

## Talent Exodus Risk

| At-Risk Worker Types | Reason |
|---------------------|--------|
| **Women** | Harassment scandal = unsafe environment |
| **POC** | Racism scandal = hostile environment |
| **LGBTQ+** | Bigotry scandal = hostile environment |
| **Young/Rising Talent** | Don't want association; have options |
| **Top Stars with Leverage** | Can leave; don't need the drama |
| **Whistleblowers** | May be retaliated against |

### Exodus Triggers

| Trigger | Worker Response |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Management defends abuser** | Release requests spike |
| **Retaliation against whistleblowers** | Mass exodus risk |
| **Multiple scandals unaddressed** | "Sinking ship" mentality |
| **Competitor offers safe haven** | Easy recruitment for rivals |

---

## Cumulative Decay: The Toxic Brand

When MULTIPLE toxic workers are shielded, the promotion builds a "toxic brand" reputation:

| Decay Level | Consequences |
|-------------|--------------|
| **0-20%** | Business as usual |
| **21-40%** | Some sponsors nervous; recruitment harder |
| **41-60%** | Sponsor pulls; talent exodus begins |
| **61-80%** | Major sponsors flee; top talent leaves |
| **81-100%** | Business collapse or forced ownership change |

### Factors Accelerating Decay

| Factor | Decay Acceleration |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Each new scandal shielded** | +10-15% decay |
| **Cover-up exposed** | +20% decay |
| **Retaliation against victims** | +25% decay |
| **Multiple chain events** | +15% per chain |
| **Management defends publicly** | +10% if proven wrong |

---

## Severity and Type Scaling

| Scandal Severity | Sponsor Risk | TV Risk | Morale Risk | Exodus Risk |
|------------------|--------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Minor** | Low | Minimal | Low | Low |
| **Moderate** | Medium | Low | Medium | Low |
| **Serious** | High | Medium | High | Medium |
| **Severe** | Very High | High | Very High | High |
| **Career-Killer** | Immediate | Immediate | Catastrophic | Mass |

---

## Who and Where Matters

| Factor | Effect on Consequences |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Worker's Star Power** | Higher = more pressure from all sides |
| **Fanbase Demographics** | Progressive fans = faster backlash |
| **Region** | Japan = different sensitivities than US |
| **Era** | Modern = everything amplified |
| **Promotion Size** | Small = may survive with niche audience; Large = corporate pressure |

## Historical Examples

| Case | Toxic Worker Action | Consequence |
|------|---------------------|-------------|

| **WWE/Hogan 2015** | Racism tape released | Immediate termination, eventual rehabilitation |
| **Various Indies** | Retained harassers | Mass walkouts, promotions collapse |
| **WCW Late Era** | Multiple toxic figures protected | Part of total company collapse |
