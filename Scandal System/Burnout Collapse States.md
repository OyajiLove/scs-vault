## Overview

When a promotion tries to survive too many scandals, shields too many toxic workers, and ignores rot too long, it doesn't just lose some pop. It collapses emotionally, financially, and politically.

**Core Truth:** You can get away with protecting one scandal. Maybe even two if you're huge and lucky. But if you keep enabling, the whole system rots from the inside out.
