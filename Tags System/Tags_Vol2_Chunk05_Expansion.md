# TAGS SYSTEM - VOL 2 CHUNK 05 EXPANSION

📌 **Source:** Vol 2 Chunk 05 (master tag spreadsheet batches, fan loyalty, scandal systems)
✅ **STATUS:** To be merged into Tags_System.md

---

## DESIGN DECISIONS (LOCKED)

### No Personality Archetypes
**Decision:** Do NOT add TEW-style personality archetypes (Arrogant, Cocky, Selfless, etc.)
**Rationale:** The tag system is already deep enough to capture personality without static archetype cages. Workers evolve through tag changes, not locked labels.

### Tag Naming Resolutions
| Old Name | New Name | Reason |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Comeback Machine | Career Resurrection Machine | Clarifies it's about career-wide resilience, not match structure |
| Monster Comeback Engine | Comeback Architect | More elegant, focuses on crafting thrilling match comeback sequences |

## FAN LOYALTY RESISTANCE SYSTEM (LOCKED)

📌 **Source:** Vol 2 Chunk 05

### System Overview

Fan loyalty determines how audiences react to scandals and betrayals. Not all fans are equally forgiving, and not all stars are equally protected.

### Factors Affecting Fan Resistance

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Fan Type (Composition) | Determines how forgiving or critical the overall audience is |
| Star Power | The bigger the star, the harder fans "want" to forgive |
| Promotion Size | The bigger the promotion, the more blind loyalty exists (up to a point) |
| Era Sensitivity | Earlier eras = more forgiveness. Modern eras = outrage is easier and faster |
| Scandal Severity | Minor scandals (cheating, DUI) = more forgivable. Career Killers (pedophilia, assault) = much harder |
| Existing Fan Relationships | Workers who are already controversial or beloved have different betrayal tolerances |

### Fanbase Types & Scandal Tolerance

| Fanbase Type | Loyalty to Star/Promotion | Scandal Tolerance | Notes |
|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Hardcore Company Loyalists | Extremely high | High tolerance | Will defend stars unless "murder-level" bad (classic WWE zombies, NJPW lifers) |
| Indie Hardcore Fans | Medium loyalty | Very low tolerance | Will turn on stars seen as "hypocrites" fast |
| Family-Friendly Fans | Medium-high loyalty | Very low tolerance | Scandals involving children, drugs, abuse kill stars instantly |
| Deathmatch Outlaw Fans | Low loyalty | Medium-high tolerance | Care more about "authenticity"; scandal is secondary unless it feels cowardly |
| Lucha Traditionalists | High loyalty | Medium tolerance | Protect local icons longer than outsiders |
| Joshi Superfans | High loyalty | Low tolerance | Purity matters; betrayals (scandals, sleaze) are devastating |
| Edgy Attitude Era Types | Medium loyalty | Medium-high tolerance | Love antiheroes, tolerate a lot of bad behaviour if it feels "badass" |

### Loyalty Resistance Formula

```
Fan Resistance % = (Base Loyalty) + (Star Power Modifier) + (Promotion Size Modifier) 
                   – (Scandal Severity Modifier) – (Era Outrage Modifier)
```

This percentage determines:
- How fast backlash happens
- How severe the pop/merch/sponsor drop is
- Whether the scandal "sticks" permanently

### Example Calculations

**Example 1: Top Star in 1986 NWA (Mid-Size Promotion)**
- Fan Type: Hardcore Territorial Loyalists
- Scandal: Cheating on wife, bar fight, DUI
- Base Loyalty: 75%
- Star Power Bonus: +10%
- Promotion Size Bonus: +5%
- Scandal Severity Penalty: -10%
- Era Outrage Penalty: -5%
- **Result: 75% loyalty resistance → Minor damage, survives scandal without much impact**

**Example 2: Rising Indie Star in 2024 (Small Promotion)**
- Fan Type: Indie Hardcore
- Scandal: Racist comments leak
- Base Loyalty: 30%
- Star Power Bonus: +5%
- Promotion Size Bonus: +0%
- Scandal Severity Penalty: -25%
- Era Outrage Penalty: -20%
- **Result: -10% loyalty resistance → Immediate collapse, fired, major hit to career**

## SCANDAL SYSTEM EXPANSIONS

📌 **Source:** Vol 2 Chunk 05

### Scandal Handling Mechanics

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Scandal Type | Different kinds: legal issues, backstage abuse, cheating, racism, etc. (covered by tags) |
| Severity | Minor (drunk photo leaks) → Moderate (DUI charge) → Severe (sexual assault) → Career Killer (murder, pedophilia) |
| Era Sensitivity | 80s: easier to cover up; 90s: media starts catching; 00s+: social media exposes everything |
| Company Protection | Big companies may try to shield major stars longer (at risk of PR disaster later) |
| Personal Fallout | Scandals can kill pushes, fan perception, cause firings, or create redemption arcs |
| Locker Room Fallout | Other workers may blacklist the scandalous person, refuse to work them, or quietly support them |
| Recurrence | Some wrestlers never learn (e.g., Jeff Hardy), others reform (e.g., Shawn Michaels) |

### Institutional Protection Reality

| Truth | SCS Implementation |
|-------|-------------------|
| Big Stars Survive | Top 1-5% names shielded by management, fans, and media bias for longer periods |
| Big Promotions Survive | WWE/NJPW-level companies take PR hits but barely budge revenue-wise |
| Fans Are Willing to Ignore | Loyalty blinds large chunks of fanbases; only sustained media heat (or competitor alternatives) cracks it |
| Smaller Promotions Die Quicker | Indies, startups, new companies cannot survive medium to severe scandals involving ownership, top stars, or champions |
| Power Brokers Know and Hide It | Executives, bookers, top wrestlers absolutely know and often protect or cover up scandals internally (until it leaks) |
| Cultural/Era Factors Matter | 80s = no internet. 90s = whispers but no mass outrage. 00s+ = social media = no hiding but still selective outrage |

### Scandal Shielding Mechanics

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Scandal Shielding | Major stars and promotions have internal "cover up" chances (temporarily delay backlash) |
| Fanbase Loyalty Buffers | Big stars have backlash delayed or softened depending on fanbase loyalty levels |
| Era Sensitivity | Earlier eras (70s-90s) can absorb scandal easier than 00s-modern eras |
| Promotion Size Risk | Smaller promotions suffer catastrophic sponsor/fanbase collapse faster after scandal exposure |
| Redemption Bias | Stars who hit bottom but have high loyalty can mount "From the Ashes" comebacks easier |
| Institutional Rot | Promotions can survive scandals if the roster/fanbase shrugs, but corruption bleeds into morale, long-term perception, and media relationships |

## CAREER ARC SYSTEM (OUTLINED)

📌 **Source:** Vol 2 Chunk 05

### Career Stages

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Rookie Years | Low pop, basic traits dominate (underdog, green, reckless, hungry) |
| Breakout | Either through miracle match, angle, or political openings; jump up cards |
| Fame | Success pressures behavior; some stay humble, some become monsters |
| Physical Decline | Injuries, aging, loss of passion start creeping |

| Reinvention | Some adapt new personas; others cling desperately to old success |
| Retirement Attempts | Some truly leave, some unretire multiple times ("One More Match") |
| Legacy | Some become legends, others fade into bitter obscurity or reinvent indie careers |

### Success Changes People (Tag Evolution)

**Core Truth:** Success doesn't change everyone, but it pressurizes their real soul.
- Some crack
- Some calcify  
- Some grow stronger
- Some stay stubbornly themselves

**Examples:**
| Wrestler | Early Career Tags | Late Career Changes |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Fiery Underdog, Solid Hand, Consummate Professional | Booking Narcissist, Big Show Hustler, Ruthless Heat Magnet |
| Darby Allin | Outsider Icon, Pain Legend, Weekend Warrior | Outsider Icon, Pain Legend (unchanged) |
| Shawn Michaels | Prodigy That Peaked Early, Reckless Brawler | Walking Headcase, Booking Martyr → Redemption Prodigy |
