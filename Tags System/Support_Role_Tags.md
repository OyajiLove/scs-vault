# SUPPORT ROLE TAGS

📛 **NAME:** Support Role Tags (Referee, Commentary)
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Tags System / Support Roles
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** referee, play-by-play, colour commentary, announcer, tags, match quality
📝 **SUMMARY:** Tag-based system for referees and commentary personnel that defines their in-ring/broadcast contributions. These tags affect match presentation, camera work, narrative delivery, and overall production quality.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Referees and commentators use tags rather than full skill blocks
- Tags evolve over time as personnel grow, decline, or adapt
- Tags affect match presentation quality and viewer experience
- No hidden skills for support roles, just visible tag combinations
- Can shift based on career trajectory and experience

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (commentary text generation benefits from tags)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 3, lines 794-796

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Tags_System]] - Master tag framework
- [[Match_Engine]] - Match quality calculations
- [[Era_System]] - Style expectations vary by era
- [[Show_Production_System]] - Broadcast quality

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- How many tags can a support role have simultaneously?
- Integration with match rating calculations (weight of ref/commentary?)
- Ring announcer tags (not yet defined)

✅ **STATUS:** Locked (Vol 3)

## REFEREE TAGS

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Match Anchor | Subtly makes everything better. Examples: Earl Hebner, Red Shoes |
| Camera Facer | Always finds the camera, helps get shots across |
| Overactor | Makes faces, oversells reactions. Example: Nick Patrick 1997 |
| Invisible Hand | Believably vanishes unless needed. Examples: Tim White, Tommy Young |
| Sells Authority | Feels like the law — adds tension. Example: Kyona in STARDOM |

## PLAY-BY-PLAY TAGS

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Narrative Purist | Sells arcs and feuds. Examples: Charlton, JR |
| Corporate Voice | Reads cards, product pusher. Example: Michael Cole |
| Clutch Screamer | Brings real energy on big moments. Examples: JR, Tony Schiavone |
| Dry Encyclopedia | Master of detail, not emotion. Examples: Mike Tenay, Charlton |
| Push-Insulter | Buries workers when they're not over. Examples: Larry Zbyszko, early JR w/ Lucha |

## COLOUR COMMENTATOR TAGS

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Heenan Heir | Comedic, antagonistic, sharp timing |
| Everyman Voice | Speaks for the casual fan. Examples: Don West, Taz |
| Try-Hard Metahead | Meme machine, too clever by half. Examples: Mauro, Excalibur |
| Vibes-First | Doesn't explain much, but hits emotional tone. Example: Don Callis |
| Flatliner | Doesn't add anything — low chemistry + presence |

## TAG EVOLUTION

Support role tags can shift over time based on:
- Experience and skill development
- Chemistry with partners
- Era and style expectations
- Career decline or growth

Example: A "Dry Encyclopedia" might develop "Clutch Screamer" moments after years on the job, or a "Heenan Heir" might become "Flatliner" as their timing slows.
