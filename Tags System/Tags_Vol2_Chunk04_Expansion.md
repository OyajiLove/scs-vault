## NON-BINARY TAG STRENGTH SYSTEM

📌 **Source:** Vol 2 Chunk 04 (CRITICAL system mechanic)

Tags are no longer binary (has/doesn't have). Each tag has a **percentage strength** from 0-100%:

| Strength % | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 0% | Doesn't have the trait at all |
| 1-30% | Very minor influence, rarely triggers |
| 31-60% | Moderate, noticeable but secondary |
| 61-90% | Strong, regular influence on booking/crowd |
| 91-100% | Defining trait, core identity |

### Example: Kevin Nash

| Tag | Estimated Strength |
|-----|-------------------|
| Cool Heel | 95% |
| Storyteller (Shoot) | 90% |
| Big Match Player | 80% |
| Is This Mania? | 85% |
| Political Kingmaker | 70% |

### Career Evolution

Tag percentages can grow or decay over time:
- Young Roman Reigns: Cool Heel 30%, Big Match Player 40%
- Modern Roman Reigns: Cool Heel 80%, Big Match Player 90%

## ETHNIC FOLK HERO SYSTEM

📌 **Source:** Vol 2 Chunk 04 (regional cultural mechanics)

### System Requirements

1. **Worker Ethnicity:** Each worker has defined ethnicity in database
2. **Regional Demographics:** Regions have demographic profiles (% Italian, % Black, % Hispanic, etc.)
3. **Cross-Check:** Ethnic Folk Hero tag triggers bonus effects only in matching regions

### Effects

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Matching Ethnicity + Region | Big loyalty boost, harder heel turns, longer drawing power |
| Mismatched Ethnicity | No automatic boost (unless Grassroots Hero Build earned) |
| Changing Generations | Regions evolve demographics over decades |
| Overexposure/Betrayal | Extra severe backlash for Folk Heroes |

### Historical Examples

| Worker | Ethnicity | Region | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|--------|
| JYD | Black | Mid-South | Huge loyalty from Black audiences |
| Sammartino | Italian | Northeast | Massive Italian-American fan surge |
| Pedro Morales | Puerto Rican | NYC | Strong Puerto Rican cultural bond |

### Grassroots Hero Build

Workers can earn Folk Hero-like loyalty over time through consistent performance and emotional connection, even without ethnic ties to the region.

## HALF-BAKED IDEAS (To Parking Lot)

📌 **Source:** Vol 2 Chunk 04 discussion threads

These concepts were discussed but not fully locked:

### Observer/Magazine PDF Processing Pipeline
**Concept:** Upload zipped PDFs of newsletters, books, magazines to mine for historical accuracy data
**Status:** Exploratory, infrastructure idea for database building
**Use Case:** Building historically accurate non-binary tag percentages for real wrestlers

### Percentage-Based Wrestler Profiles
**Concept:** Building real-world wrestlers with non-binary tag strengths (0-100%)
**Status:** Discussed, needs implementation framework
**Example:** Kevin Nash: Cool Heel 95%, Storyteller 90%, Is This Mania? 85%

### Era Filters for Simulation
**Concept:** Simulate different eras differently (1986 Mid-South vs 2002 NOAH)
**Status:** Conceptual, ties to Era System

### Regional Culture Filters
**Concept:** Different crowd loyalty/heat expectations by region
**Status:** Conceptual, ties to Territory System

### Scandal Risk Calculators
**Concept:** Calculate scandal probability based on tag clusters (Party Animal + Ring Intoxicated = high risk)
**Status:** Conceptual, ties to Scandal System

### Multi-generational Worker Bloodlines
**Concept:** Von Erichs, Anoa'i Family systems with inherited traits and curse mechanics
**Status:** Mentioned, needs formal design

### Gimmick Prison vs Career Chameleon Paths
**Concept:** Different evolution routes for worker persona development
**Status:** Tags exist, formal path system not designed

### Worker Generator System
**Concept:** Creating fictional workers using tag templates and archetype combinations
**Status:** Mentioned, ties to World Builder

### Master Tag CSV with Three Columns
**Concept:** Trait Name | Description | Category format for database
**Status:** Discussed, format defined but not generated
