## NEW TAGS (CHUNK 10)

### PROMO STYLE TAGS

---

#### Melodramatic
**Category:** Promo Style (Personality Tag)

**Description:** Worker leans into emotional excess: long pauses, theatrical delivery, big gestures, tearful speeches. Can succeed with fans who love performance drama but may backfire in stoic or smark-heavy fanbases.

**Effects:**
- Boosted emotional pop if crowd DNA matches (casuals, kids, some female-heavy demos)
- Risk of backlash or detachment in mismatched fanbases
- Enhanced vulnerability to "crybaby" chants if story doesn't support
- Can lead to Promo Backlash Modifier in legacy-focused feds

**Examples:** 
- HBK (mid-90s)
- Cody Rhodes (when overdoing it)
- Early '90s Sting (sometimes)

**EXPLICIT EXCLUSION:** Johnny Gargano is permanently excluded from receiving positive narrative bonuses from this or related tags. His "Shawn-core" acting style is considered performative excess without earned emotional depth.

### CAREER TRAJECTORY TAGS

---

#### Long-Term Emotional Investment
**Category:** Career Trajectory (Permanent Personality Trait)

**Description:** Worker excels at building slow-burn emotional arcs with deep fan buy-in. They can carry feuds over years and maintain intensity, even with long absences. This is WHO THEY ARE, not something easily earned.

**Effects:**
- Boosts feud memory retention
- Boosts segment resonance in emotional storylines
- Enhances crowd investment in career arcs
- Increases payoff multiplier for long-term feud conclusions

**Requirements:** Must be proven to carry deep stories that fans stick with across years and angles. Not assigned lightly.

**Examples:**
- Adam Page (Hangman)
- Kenny Omega
- Toshiaki Kawada
- Akira Hokuto
- Kenta Kobashi
- Mitsuharu Misawa
- Eddie Kingston
- Dustin Rhodes
- Tomohiro Ishii (in silent pain form)
- Swerve Strickland

**EXPLICIT EXCLUSION:** Johnny Gargano does NOT receive this tag despite NXT storylines. The melodramatic acting style without sustained believability disqualifies.

## CULTURAL NOTES (LOCKED)

### Japanese Fan Behavior
NJPW and most Japanese promotion fans are **deeply kayfabe loyal**, not meta:
- They understand emotional nuance better than most
- They do NOT boo against type just because someone is "cool"
- Home loyalty exists but cultural alignment > geography
- Hometown crowds will boo their own if narrative earns it (e.g., Taichi)
- Exception: Naito 2017 cool heel fandom was EARNED through years of story, not easily replicated

### Push Disbelief Backlash
When Japanese fans boo someone like Shota Umino despite babyface booking, this represents **Push Disbelief** not heel appreciation. The system tracks this differently from Western "meta" fan reactions.
