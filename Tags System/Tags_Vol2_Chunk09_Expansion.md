## NEW TAGS (Vol 2 Chunk 09)

### Pain Tolerance Tags

| Tag | Category | Description | Gameplay Impact |
|-----|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| High Pain Tolerance | Physical Attribute | Physically resilient to hardcore, deathmatch, brutal stipulation bumps | Lower injury chance during brutal matches; higher crowd respect during violent matches; slower mental health toll during brawls |
| Low Pain Tolerance | Physical Attribute | Struggles with extreme matches | Higher injury risk; faster emotional burnout from hardcore environments |

**Note:** Workers without either tag are neutral (no boost or penalty).

---

### Creativity & Violence Tags

| Tag | Category | Description | Gameplay Impact |
|-----|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Innovator of Violence | In-Ring Performance | Unusually creative with weapons, hardcore improvisation, and unique visual spots in violent matches | Raises hardcore match quality dramatically if conditions allow |

**Named alternatives considered:** "Creative Weapon Use," "Thank You Tommy" (too niche/inside baseball)

**Note:** Workers without this tag are neutral in weapon-based matches. This is a rare, specialized tag for deathmatch wizards, hardcore innovators, some lucha weirdos.

### Backstage Behavior Tags

| Tag | Category | Description | Gameplay Impact |
|-----|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Loose Lips | Personality/Backstage Behaviour | Talks too freely in locker room, to fans, interviewers, or media. May unintentionally expose secrets, scandals, heat, or future booking plans | Increases chance of rumours surfacing, gossip spreading, or accidental exposure; affects locker room stability and booking secrecy |

**Subcategory:** Locker Room Dynamics / Info Management

**Distinction from Dirtsheet Gossip:** Loose Lips is not always malicious (can be a "sweet dumbass who reveals too much on Twitch streams"). Dirtsheet Gossip is deliberate leaking to press/media for self-promotion, sabotage, or political leverage.
