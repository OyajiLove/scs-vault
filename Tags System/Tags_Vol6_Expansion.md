## NEW TAGS (Vol 6)

### Fanbase/Gimmick Tags

| Tag | Description | Mechanical Effect |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| **Cult Follower Favorite** | Worker has devoted niche following rather than mainstream popularity. Think ECW originals, Japanese death match kings, indie darlings. | Buzz→Popularity conversion is SLOWER (hardcore fans don't create mainstream momentum quickly) but STRONGER when it does convert (cult fans are loyal, conversions are sticky and resistant to decay). May never reach Pop 80+ but maintains floor better than mainstream stars. |

### Emotional Tags (Used for Memory Snapshots)

These tags, when present during high-Buzz moments, increase the likelihood of creating a [[Fan Memory Engine/Memory Snapshots|Memory Snapshot]]:

| Tag | Description | Memory Effect |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| **Catharsis** | Moment of emotional release, long-awaited payoff | High memory weight; slower decay |
| **Betrayal** | Trust violated, alliance shattered | Very high memory weight; can create permanent feud anchors |
| **Redemption** | Comeback from failure, disgrace, or doubt | High memory weight; boosts Legacy calculations |
| **Sympathy** | Underdog energy, crowd feels for the worker | Can grow Pop even through losses (Vol 6 edge case) |
| **Courage** | Worker showed heart, refused to quit | Sera Koizumi example: "Courage + Buzz 18 = Legacy-defining" |
| **Spectacle** | Visually stunning, jaw-dropping moment | Medium memory weight; often combined with other tags |
| **Nihilism** | Dark, fatalistic, deathmatch-adjacent energy | Sal Devlin example: "Spectacle + Nihilism + Buzz 17 = Permanent aura boost" |

### Regional Bias Tags

| Tag | Description | Mechanical Effect |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|
| **Homegrown Hero** | Worker is from this region, crowd claims them as their own | Regional memory decays slower; regional Pop gains boosted; "In Cork... they still chant his name" effect |

## TAG SYSTEM INTERACTIONS (Vol 6)

### Buzz→Pop Conversion Modifier Tags

These tags affect how [[Buzz System/Buzz to Pop Conversion|Buzz converts to Popularity]]:

| Tag | Conversion Effect |
|-----|-------------------|
| Cult Follower Favorite | Slower conversion rate, but gains are more persistent |
| (Future: Mainstream Appeal) | Faster conversion, but gains decay faster |
| (Future: Regional Hero) | Conversion boosted in home region, penalized elsewhere |

## NOTES

Vol 6 introduces the concept that certain gimmick tags modify the Buzz→Pop formula. This creates worker archetypes beyond raw stats:

- **Cult stars** who maintain steady heat but never explode
- **Flash-in-the-pan** types who spike and crash
- **Regional kings** who dominate one area but can't translate

This should integrate with [[Gimmick System/_Gimmick System Index|Gimmick System]] lifecycle mechanics.
