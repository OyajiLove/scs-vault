# Gimmick System

📛 **SYSTEM:** Gimmick System
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker Identity / Presentation
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** gimmick, character, persona, alignment, heel turn, face turn, iconic lock, cultural immortal
📝 **SUMMARY:** A structured identity system managing a worker's presented character: name, look, style, alignment, tone, and emotional layer. Gimmicks have lifecycles (debut to burnout), can achieve "Iconic Lock" status for sustained overness, and in rare cases become "Cultural Immortals" beyond normal booking logic.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Each worker has ONE active gimmick at a time (can switch, evolve, or resurrect old ones)
- Gimmicks follow a lifecycle: Debut → Climb → Peak → Stagnation → Burnout → Rebirth
- High-legacy gimmicks can achieve "Iconic Lock" (protected from normal decay)
- Cultural Immortals (Mil Máscaras, Santo, Muta) transcend normal booking rules entirely
- Gimmick ≠ [[Tags_System|Tags]]: Tags are "who you are underneath"; Gimmick is "who the fans see"
- Gimmicks directly affect [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz]], [[Fan Memory Engine/_Fan Memory Index|Fan Memory]], Merch, and Booking decisions

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes. LLM can assist with gimmick evolution narratives, promo writing for character shifts, and generating gimmick concepts for AI-created workers.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 6 (fully formalized with Iconic Lock and Cultural Immortal subsystems)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz System]] - Gimmicks determine Buzz caps, burnout risk
- [[Fan Memory Engine/_Fan Memory Index|Fan Memory Engine]] - High-emotion gimmicks generate snapshots
- [[Legacy Tracker/_Legacy Tracker Index|Legacy Tracker]] - Gimmick names can be inducted into HOF
- [[Turn_Engine]] - Gimmick alignment changes processed here
- [[Ceremony Tools]] - Gimmick funerals, mask tributes

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact thresholds for Iconic Lock trigger (Legacy 80+? Sustained Buzz 15+ for X months?)
- Dual Identity mechanics (The Demon, Mankind/Cactus Jack) need formal rules
- Gimmick inheritance between workers (passing the mask)

✅ **STATUS:** Locked
