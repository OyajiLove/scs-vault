## Version History

| Version | Volume | Changes |
|---------|--------|--------|
| v1.0 | Vol 6 | **LOCKED** - Two break types defined: Catastrophic (scandal/burial) and Creative (subversion/heel turn). Severity levels, triggers, and recovery paths specified. Bash at the Beach 1996 as canonical subversion example. |

---

## Overview

Iconic Locks can be broken in two ways:

1. **Catastrophic Break** - Scandal, burial, or real-world disaster shatters the gimmick
2. **Creative Subversion** - Intentional heel turn, betrayal, or identity rupture that transforms the gimmick into something new

> "I am not your hero anymore."

# PART 1: CATASTROPHIC BREAKS

## Catastrophic Break Triggers

| Trigger | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| **Major scandal** | Immediate break risk |
| **Sustained burial** | Gradual break over months |
| **Shoot incident** | Context-dependent |
| **Criminal conviction** | Near-automatic break |
| **Company collapse** | Regional break (WCW death affecting WCW-only icons) |
| **Death under bad circumstances** | Complex (can freeze or break) |

---

## Break Severity Levels

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Cracked** | Lock weakened, recovery possible |
| **Fractured** | Significant damage, difficult recovery |
| **Shattered** | Lock destroyed, gimmick becomes liability |
| **Erased** | Promotion pretends gimmick never existed |

---

## Post-Break States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Rebuild possible** | Worker can attempt new Iconic Lock with same or new gimmick |
| **Diminished legacy** | Gimmick remembered but with asterisk |
| **Toxic association** | Any mention damages associated workers/promotions |
| **Selective memory** | Fans remember peak, ignore fall |

---

## Recovery Paths

| Path | Requirements |
|------|---------------|
| **Time heal** | Extended absence, let memories fade |
| **Reinvention** | New gimmick, distance from old |
| **Redemption arc** | Acknowledge fall, earn back trust |
| **Context shift** | New promotion, new audience |
| **Death freeze** | Passing can freeze legacy at last good point |

---

## Catastrophic Break Examples

| Worker | Break Type | Recovery |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Hulk Hogan (2015) | Scandal | Partial rebuild, diminished |
| Chris Benoit | Catastrophic | Erased, no recovery |
| Ric Flair (late career) | Gradual decay | Selective memory |
| Ultimate Warrior | Company conflict | Time heal + death freeze |

# PART 2: GIMMICK SUBVERSION BREAKS (Vol 6)

How to **intentionally** shatter a sacred gimmick and survive the fallout.

## Purpose

Simulate major character subversions: heel turns, betrayals, death of innocence, identity ruptures that break through nostalgia, change booking forever, and generate new myth arcs.

---

## When Can a Lock Be Subverted?

Only [[Iconic Lock|Iconic Locked Gimmicks]] can be subverted this way, those that:
- Have sustained overness for years
- Are memory-protected
- Are entwined with promotion identity
- Are at or near burnout but still in power

These are high-stakes turns. Crowd reaction will either explode... or collapse trust permanently.

---

## Subversion Triggers (with Weights)

| Trigger Type | Description | Weight |
|--------------|-------------|--------|
| 🧨 **Heel Turn Betrayal** | Turns on longtime ally or symbolic face (e.g., Savage) | Very High |
| 🎭 **Gimmick Inversion** | Keeps look, flips meaning ("You bought the lie") | High |
| 🗣 **Shoot Promo Reveal** | Calls out fans, company, or own legacy as fraud | High |
| ⚰ **Symbolic Death** | Burns attire, unmasks, retires name in-ring | Medium |
| 🧬 **Match Style Shift** | Suddenly works violent, grounded, heel style | Medium |
| 😐 **Promo Silence** | Refuses to speak, lets gesture carry betrayal | Medium |
| 🤝 **Shocking Alliance** | Joins hated rival group (e.g., Hogan joins Hall & Nash) | Very High |

> The more emotionally loaded and contextually earned, the more likely the Break succeeds.

---

## System Resolution: How It Plays Out

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ⚖ **Booking Check** | Is this the right time based on crowd heat, feud memory, booking trails? |
| 💥 **Fan Reaction Roll** | Crowd may cheer, boo, go silent, or riot (region + personality modifiers) |
| 🧠 **Memory Imprint** | If it lands, generates a major [[Fan Memory Engine/Memory Snapshots|Fan Memory Snapshot]] |
| 🔁 **Gimmick Swap or Inversion** | Old gimmick is marked "Broken"; new one begins tracking |
| 🏛 **Legacy Fork** | Old legacy is now "pre-betrayal"; new arc builds separately |
| ⚠ **Fallout Flags** | AI/booker decisions, locker room heat, morale shifts, merch risk all triggered |

---

## Simulation Variables Affecting Success

| Variable | Influence |
|----------|-----------|
| **Region Conservatism** | Japanese puro crowds may resist deathmatch flips; southern US crowds may revolt at babyface betrayal |
| **Worker Personality** | High Ego + High Drive workers want control of the turn; if mishandled, they may sabotage it |
| **Fan Memory Freshness** | If the gimmick hasn't peaked in years, the break is often welcome |
| **Promotion Style** | Lucha libre sacred mask turns carry more weight than US-style rebrands |
| **Feud Timing** | Breaks that pay off betrayal seeds are more successful than shock-value-only turns |

---

## Bash at the Beach 1996: Canonical Example

> "When Hulk Hogan came out, the crowd popped. When he leg dropped Savage, they exploded."

That heel turn:
- **Destroyed** the previous Hulkamania lock
- **Created** a New Gimmick Arc (Hollywood Hogan) with elevated buzz ceiling
- **Generated** a Fan Memory Snapshot of historical weight
- **Split** the fanbase permanently (face chants vs heel loyalty)

---

## Resulting Lock States (Updated)

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Iconic Lock Active** | Fans support gimmick out of love, memory, and inertia |
| **Stagnation Risk** | Overexposure + booking drift triggers decay |
| **Decay Warnings** | Buzz flattening, segment rejection, ironic chants |
| **Lock Break Event** | Heel turn, betrayal, or reinvention blows open a new arc |
| **Legacy Secured** | Even if gimmick fails, its memory becomes immortal |

---

## Connected Mechanics

- [[Iconic Lock]] - what's being broken
- [[Iconic Lock Decay]] - the process leading to break
- [[Fan Memory Engine/_Fan Memory Index|Fan Memory]] - break creates memories (positive or negative)
- [[Cultural Immortality]] - can be lost via catastrophic break
- [[Turn_Engine]] - processes the alignment change
- [[Feud_Memory]] - betrayal seeds affect success

---

## Open Questions

- Can broken locks ever fully recover to previous peak?
- Inheritance effects (does breaking Hogan affect nWo members?)
- Simulation ethics: how to handle real-world tragedies?
- Exact formula for Fan Reaction Roll
- Multiple subversion attempts: diminishing returns?

## Part 3: Lock Break Outcomes (Vol 6)

### If It Lands

| Outcome | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Buzz Spike | +10+ massive momentum, especially if televised |
| Pop Shift (Regionalized) | May lose fans in core markets, gain new ones elsewhere |
| Gimmick Slot Changes | New gimmick becomes active; broken one archived with "Fall From Grace" flag |
| Booking Trail Fork | Storyline memory anchors fracture into new trails |
| Media & Commentary Update | New narrative permanently remembered as the moment the mask cracked |
| HOF Voter Bias Shift | Either seen as tragic decline... or bold reinvention |

### If It Fails

| Fallout | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Fan apathy or backlash | "Who asked for this?" = Buzz collapse |
| Gimmick stuck in limbo | Neither face nor heel, just resented |
| Locker room mockery | "He's chasing relevance" chatter spreads |
| Promotion damage | May hurt brand if gimmick was central (e.g., kids' market collapses) |
| Booking trust penalty | AI booker less likely to greenlight creative risks again |

> "The system doesn't reward shock — it rewards earned reinvention."
