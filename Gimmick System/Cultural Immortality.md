## Version History

| Version | Volume | Changes |
|---------|--------|--------|
| v1.0 | Vol 6 | **LOCKED** - Cultural Immortality defined as tier beyond Iconic Lock. Criteria established (multi-generational, non-wrestling fame, symbol status). Immortal privileges codified. El Santo, Rikidōzan, André the Giant used as canonical examples |

**Note:** The synthesis report mentions "Cultural Immortals (Mil Máscaras, Santo, Muta) transcend normal booking rules entirely" as core to this mechanic's purpose.

## Overview

A tier beyond [[Iconic Lock]]. Cultural Immortals have transcended wrestling entirely to become permanent fixtures in broader cultural consciousness. Normal booking rules don't fully apply; they exist on a different plane.

---

## What Makes a Cultural Immortal

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Multi-generational recognition** | Grandparents and grandchildren both know them |
| **Non-wrestling fame** | Known by people who've never watched wrestling |
| **Symbol status** | Represent something beyond themselves (heroism, rebellion, etc.) |
| **Historical permanence** | Will be remembered 50+ years after retirement |
| **Cultural penetration** | Referenced in non-wrestling media constantly |

---

## Examples

| Immortal | Cultural Meaning | Region |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| **El Santo** | Mexican national hero, religious iconography | Mexico/Global |
| **Rikidōzan** | Japanese national pride, post-war recovery | Japan |
| **André the Giant** | Gentle giant archetype, The Princess Bride | Global |
| **Hulk Hogan** (peak) | American heroism, 80s optimism | USA/Global |
| **The Rock** | Transcended to Hollywood A-list | Global |

## Immortal vs Iconic Lock

| Aspect | Iconic Lock | Cultural Immortal |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Decay possible? | Yes, slowly | Almost never |

| Return pop? | Guaranteed | Transcendent |
| Death effect? | Freezes legacy | Elevates to myth |
| Fan memory? | Strong | Permanent |

## Immortal Privileges

| Privilege | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Untouchable booking** | Cannot be buried by any booker |
| **Automatic main event** | Any appearance is main event level |
| **Cross-promotion draw** | Draw regardless of company |
| **Legacy immunity** | Bad matches don't hurt legacy |
| **Death elevation** | Passing increases cultural status |

## Achieving Immortality

Extremely rare. Requirements beyond Iconic Lock:

1. Sustained Iconic Lock for 10+ years
2. Cultural penetration beyond wrestling
3. Symbolic meaning to broader society
4. Multi-generational recognition
5. Some element of tragedy, triumph, or myth

Most workers never achieve this. Most Iconic Locks remain "just" iconic.
