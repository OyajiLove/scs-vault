## Version History

| Version | Volume | Changes |
|---------|--------|--------|
| v1.0 | Vol 1-4 | "Perma-over" concept discussed for legendary characters; no formal trigger system |
| v2.0 | Vol 6 | **LOCKED** - Iconic Lock formalized with trigger conditions (Legacy 80+, Buzz 15+ sustained, cultural penetration). Decay immunity, booking protection, and memory permanence effects specified |

---

## Overview

When a gimmick achieves such cultural penetration that it becomes permanently protected from normal decay mechanics. The character is "locked in" to the cultural consciousness.

---

## Trigger Conditions

A gimmick achieves Iconic Lock when:

| Condition | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| [[Legacy Tracker/_Legacy Tracker Index|Legacy Score]] | 80+ |
| Sustained [[Buzz Scale|Buzz]] | 15+ for 6+ months |
| Cultural Penetration | Referenced outside wrestling context |
| Cross-generational | Recognized by non-fans |

All conditions must be met. Partial achievement = "Near-Iconic" status.

---

## Iconic Lock Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Decay immunity** | [[Buzz Decay]] no longer applies normally |
| **Return pop guaranteed** | Any return generates automatic Buzz spike |
| **Booking protection** | AI bookers won't bury the character |
| **Memory permanence** | [[Fan Memory Engine/_Fan Memory Index|Fan Memory]] never fully forgets |
| **Merch immortality** | Continues selling even during absence |
| **Legacy ceiling raised** | Can reach [[Cultural Immortality]] tier |

---

## Real-World Examples

| Gimmick | Lock Trigger | Era |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Hulkamania** | WrestleMania III, cultural phenomenon | Mid-80s |
| **Stone Cold** | Austin 3:16, beer truck, Mr. McMahon feud | Late 90s |
| **The Undertaker** | Streak, supernatural mystique | Early 90s |
| **John Cena** | Make-A-Wish, mainstream crossover | Mid-2000s |
| **Great Muta** | International icon, green mist, paint | Late 80s Japan |

## Perma-Over Gimmicks: The Immune Class (Vol 6)

Some gimmicks resist the standard burnout curve. They remain over, sometimes for decades, despite repetition, minimal evolution, or even cultural backlash.

> "You can't teach charisma, and you can't kill magic if the crowd's still chanting."

### Immune Class Triggers

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🌍 **Cultural Saturation** | Gimmick recognized outside wrestling context |
| 🏛 **Legacy Tie-In** | Connected to promotion's defining moments |
| ⚖ **Symbolic Role** | Represents something larger (era, movement, fanbase) |
| 💰 **Commercial Lock-In** | Merch still sells, sponsors still want them |
| 🧠 **Memory Density** | Multiple Fan Memory Snapshots reinforce identity |

---

## Gimmick Endurance State: "Iconic Lock" Effects

Once triggered, the gimmick enters this protected state:

| Effect | Outcome |
|--------|----------|
| 📉 **Buzz decay slows dramatically** | Worker can coast without innovating |
| 📈 **Pop floor rises** | Even bad years don't kill fanbase |
| ⏸ **Burnout curve freezes mid-stage** | No sharp falloff unless scandal or forced heel turn |
| 🎤 **Commentary mythologizes the gimmick** | "He's not who he was... but listen to this place!" |
| 🧠 **Fan Memory reinforces in segments** | AI commentary references classic moments every time |
| ⚠ **Political risk increases backstage** | Other workers may resent the sacred cow |
| 🤖 **AI Bookers treat it differently** | Even chaotic bookers hesitate to break the myth without cause |

---

## Gimmick Longevity Examples (Vol 6)

| Worker | Gimmick | Longevity |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Hulk Hogan | Hulkamania | 1984-2002 (then reinvented as nostalgia act) |
| Mil Máscaras | "Living Mask God" | Untouchable for 40+ years |
| John Cena | Never Give Up / Face of Company | Over with kids + merch even after adult backlash |
| The Undertaker | Deadman Persona | Stopped being reinvented after 2005, still lasted another 15 years |
| Great Muta | Semi-mythical occult assassin | Protected even when aging out |

---

## AI Handling of Iconic Gimmicks (Vol 6)

| Booker Style | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| **Traditionalist** | Honors it, protects booking, gives ceremonial spot |
| **Heat Merchant** | Might use the gimmick's overness to fuel betrayal or scandal |
| **Chaos Booker** | Tries to kill it, but faces risk of fan revolt |
| **Star Maker** | Books "passing torch" angles, only if crowd accepts new heir |
| **Purist / Realist** | Resists overexposure, may try to evolve the gimmick (often fails) |

---

## When Iconic Gimmicks Collapse (Vol 6)

| Trigger | Collapse Risk |
|---------|---------------|
| **Scandal** | High, fans can turn instantly if betrayal is personal or ideological |
| **Misused Heel Turn** | Medium, if it violates emotional contract (see: heel Cena fantasy booking) |
| **Forced Repackage** | High, gimmick inertia works both ways (audience rejects it outright) |
| **Identity Theft** (new wrestler mimics it) | Medium, may expose original or hurt both |

These collapses become memory events and affect the promotion's cultural stability.

## Near-Iconic Status

Workers who approach but don't fully achieve lock:

- High legacy but limited cultural penetration
- Iconic within wrestling, unknown outside
- Regional icons (huge in Japan, unknown in US)

Near-Iconic workers:
- Get partial decay protection
- Can achieve full lock with right booking
- Risk falling back without maintenance

---

## Connected Mechanics

- [[Iconic Lock Decay]] - even locked gimmicks can fade
- [[Lock Break System]] - catastrophic events that shatter locks
- [[Cultural Immortality]] - tier above Iconic Lock
- [[Legacy Tracker/_Legacy Tracker Index|Legacy Tracker]] - feeds into lock calculation

---

## Open Questions

- Exact formula for lock calculation
- Regional Iconic Lock (locked in Japan but not US)?
- Tag team Iconic Lock (Road Warriors, Dudleys)?
