---

## Standard Types

|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Singles** | 1 vs 1 | Pin, submission, countout, DQ |
| **Tag Team** | 2 vs 2 | Pin/submit legal competitor |
| **Six-Man Tag** | 3 vs 3 | Pin/submit legal competitor |

---

## Special Formats

| Type | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Gauntlet (Team)** | Winner stays on, elimination continues | Tests endurance, builds star via survival |
| **Captain's Fall Elimination** | If captain eliminated, whole team loses | High stakes, protects tag partners |
| **Battle Royal** | 10-30+ competitors, over-the-top elimination | Can be serious or light-hearted |
| **Royal Rumble Style** | Timed entry battle royal | Builds drama through entry order |
| **Ironman Match** | Most falls in time limit wins | Tests stamina, psychology |
| **Last Man Standing** | 10-count after knockdown | Brutality showcase |

---

## Light-Hearted Battle Royals

AJPW-style tension breakers:

- Used for morale boost, not storyline advancement
- Lower stakes, comedy spots acceptable
- Often placed mid-card to reset crowd energy
- Can feature unlikely eliminations, near-misses
- Workers who need protection can be eliminated early without damage

---

## Tag Team Variants

| Variant | Rule Modification |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Tornado Tag** | All competitors legal simultaneously |
| **Texas Tornado** | No tags required, brawl style |
| **Lucha Rules** | Exit ring = partner can enter |
| **Blind Tags** | Tags legal without partner's awareness |

## Match Type Attributes

### Risqué Level

Measures sexual suggestiveness relative to era and region. What's shocking in 1985 is normalized by 1999 and irrelevant by 2020.

| Match Type | Era | Risqué Level | Notes |
|------------|-----|--------------|-------|
| **Bra & Panties** | 1985 | Extremely High | Would be scandalous |
| **Bra & Panties** | 1999 | Normalized | Attitude Era standard |
| **Bra & Panties** | 2020s | Irrelevant | Match type discontinued |
| **Evening Gown Match** | 1990s | Moderate-High | Depends on execution |
| **Pudding/Mud Match** | 1990s-2000s | High | Exploitation spectacle |
| **Standard Women's Match** | Any era | None | Professional competition |

**System Effect:** High Risqué Level in conservative eras/regions = scandal risk, sponsor concern, worker morale issues.

| Match Type | Primary Skills Required |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Last Man Standing** | Selling, Psychology, Pacing |

| **Chain/Strap/Bullrope** | Brawling, Selling, Toughness |
| **I Quit Match** | Selling, Psychology, Promo Skills |
| **Hardcore/Deathmatch** | Brawling, Pain Tolerance (tag), Improvisation |

## Emotional Toll & Fanbase Splitting

### Psychological Cost of Brutal Matches

| Match Type | Mental Health Impact | Long-Term Risk |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Standard Singles** | Minimal | None |
| **Hardcore Brawl** | Minor drain | Low burnout risk |
| **Deathmatch (Light)** | Moderate drain | Career pigeonholing |
| **Deathmatch (Heavy)** | Major drain | PTSD-like burnout, "deathmatch guy" label |
| **Extreme Ladder/TLC** | Moderate-Major | Cumulative body damage |

### Fanbase Splitting Effect

**Some fans love bloody blowoffs, others see them as gross/self-parody.**

| Fan Reaction Type | Response to Brutal Matches |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Hardcore loyalists** | More invested, pop huge |
| **Mainstream casuals** | Turned off, may stop watching |
| **Purist workrate fans** | Appreciate drama but prefer clean work |
| **Family audience** | Alienated, negative word of mouth |

**Booking Consideration:** Repeated deathmatches pigeonhole workers. "Deathmatch guy" limits mainstream career options, HOF eligibility, and promotion flexibility.

---

## Era-Based Booking Flavor

Promotions develop evolving booking habits by era. Match type selection reflects promotion identity at specific times.

### Example: All Japan Pro Wrestling

| Era | Booking Flavor |
|-----|---------------|
| **1990-92** | Heavy 6-man/8-man tags monthly, light-hearted battle royals |
| **1994-98** | Serious singles and tag wars, less chaos, quality over quantity |

### Example: New Japan Pro Wrestling

| Era | Booking Flavor |
|-----|---------------|
| **1987-90** | Gauntlet tournaments, UWF invasion angles, shoot-style integration |
| **2000s** | More singles focus, G1 Climax prominence |
| **2010s-20s** | Epic long matches, storytelling emphasis |

### Example: Pro Wrestling NOAH

| Era | Booking Flavor |
|-----|---------------|
| **2000-05** | Captain's Fall emphasis, respect/emotion themes, dignified presentation |

### Example: WCW

| Era | Booking Flavor |
|-----|---------------|
| **1997** | Hot openers, bait-and-switch, NWO chaos overshadows matches |
| **1998-99** | Increasingly chaotic, finishes muddied, crowd conditioned to expect screwjobs |
