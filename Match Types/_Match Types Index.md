# Match Types & Era Flavor System

📛 **SYSTEM:** Match Types & Era Flavor
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Match Simulation / Booking Context
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** match types, era flavor, house style, stipulation, booking style, King's Road, Strong Style
📝 **SUMMARY:** Defines available match formats, distinguishes match types from house styles, and establishes era-based booking flavor that affects how matches are judged and perceived. Critical insight: Strong Style, King's Road, etc. are promotion house styles, NOT match types.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Match types are structural formats (singles, tag, gauntlet, etc.)
- House styles are promotion philosophies that flavor how matches are booked and judged
- Era profiles define booking norms for specific promotions in specific time periods
- Match quality is evaluated against era/regional expectations, not universal standards
- Stipulation matches (cage, ladder, etc.) are match type modifiers

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes. LLM can generate match commentary flavored by house style, suggest era-appropriate booking decisions, and evaluate match quality in context.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 3 (match types locked, era flavor locked)
