# Worker-Title Emotional Bond System

📛 **NAME:** Worker-Title Emotional Bond System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Title System / Emotional Memory  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** title, belt, bond, prestige, legacy, Okada, IWGP, redemption, false king  
📝 **SUMMARY:** System for how certain workers become emotionally fused with specific titles, creating co-mythologized bonds. Titles aren't just belts, they're emotional artifacts tied to workers, promotions, crowd loyalty, and match memory. Breaking these bonds (worker buries title, promotion mishandles belt, successor doesn't earn it) can either build myths or rot emotional loyalty permanently.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Bonds form through: Historic Reigns, Redemption Arcs, Tragic Losses, Mythical Artifact Matches
- Bonds can be broken through: Worker burial, Promotion mishandling, Successor "false kings"
- Workers and titles co-mythologize each other
- Titles have emotional gravity that must be respected narratively

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (LLM can narrate title significance, describe bond formation, generate prestige commentary)

## Core Concept

In SCS, titles aren't just belts. They are emotional artifacts tied to:
- Workers
- Promotions
- Crowd loyalty
- Match memory

Certain workers become emotionally fused with specific titles. Losing, betraying, or abusing that emotional bond can either build myths or rot emotional loyalty permanently.

**Workers and titles co-mythologize each other.**

## How Worker-Title Bonds Form ✅ LOCKED

| Trigger | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Historic Title Reigns** | Long, emotional title defenses where fans connect to survival, struggle arcs (Okada IWGP runs) |
| **Career Redemption Arcs** | Workers finally winning titles after years of emotional investment (Hangman Page AEW) |
| **Tragic Title Losses** | Workers losing titles unfairly, brutally, or tragically. Scars remain even post-title. |
| **Mythical Artifact Matches** | Titles associated with industry-defining matches anchor deeper emotional memory |

---

## What Happens When Title Bonds are Broken or Betrayed ✅ LOCKED

| Scenario | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Worker Buries Title** | If a beloved worker mistreats or mocks a belt emotionally, crowd loyalty drops |
| **Promotion Mishandles Belt** | If promotions abandon title memory (cold shots, mechanical tournaments), title prestige and emotional memory rot |
| **Successor Mishandling** | Workers inheriting emotional belts without earning fan loyalty create "false kings". Fans emotionally resist reigns. |

---

## Philosophy

> "In SCS, belts aren't just stats or trophies. They are emotional myths tied to workers, fans, and world memory. Break a title's emotional bond and you break your promotion's soul."

---

## Gameplay Impact

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Title Shot Booking** | Workers bonded to titles get priority consideration for returns, reunion matches |
| **Successor Acceptance** | New champions must earn fan acceptance or face "false king" resistance |
| **Title Prestige Tracking** | Mishandled titles lose prestige over time, affecting match importance |
| **Promotion Identity** | Title handling reflects and shapes promotion soul |
