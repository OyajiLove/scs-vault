# Title Lineage Damage and Protection

📛 **NAME:** Title Lineage Damage and Protection System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Title System / Belt Integrity  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** title, belt, lineage, prestige, damage, vacancy, theft, protection, ring sanctity  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how championships gain or lose prestige based on booking stability, champion behavior, and crisis events. Includes damage mechanics from walkouts, scandals, and hot-potato booking, plus protection systems for recovery.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Title prestige damaged by walkouts, scandals, frequent vacancies, mockery
- Damage accumulates in "Legacy Memory" affecting long-term belt perception
- Protection systems: Ring Sanctity setting, Title Recovery Arcs, Belt Protector workers
- Promotions with unstable titles lose global prestige and recruitment appeal
- Some workers naturally protect title dignity ("Belt Protector" trait)

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (deterministic prestige calculations; LLM could generate title history narratives)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 136-140 (locked)

## 1. TITLE DAMAGE TRIGGERS

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Champion Walks Out** | Refuses to drop title properly (Montreal, Medusa trash incident) |
| **Clique Coup or Mass Exodus** | Titleholders shift allegiances, vanish, politicize reigns |
| **Scandal Erupts** | Arrests, suspensions, PR disasters involving champions |
| **Booking Crisis** | Hot-potato chaos, rushed vacancies, meaningless tournament wins |
| **Title Theft/Defacement** | Workers steal, damage, mock belts post-walkout |

---

## 2. TITLE DAMAGE MECHANICS

| Layer | Simulation Behavior |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Legacy Memory Shift** | Belts associated with humiliation/instability lose prestige across eras |
| **Immediate Vacating Penalties** | Stripping without strong storylines craters belt prestige |
| **Title Theft/Defacement Events** | Medusa-style incidents create permanent memory anchors |
| **Emergency Tournament Penalty** | Scramble tournaments judged harshly on quality and perceived fairness |
| **Fan Trust Degradation** | Frequent instability = titles seen as "props" instead of sacred |

### Damage Severity Scale

| Damage Type | Prestige Hit | Recovery Time |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Clean Title Change Gone Wrong** | -5 to -10 | 1-3 months |
| **Champion No-Show/Walkout** | -15 to -25 | 6-12 months |
| **Title Thrown in Trash (Medusa)** | -30 to -40 | 1-3 years |
| **Hot-Potato Booking (3+ changes/month)** | -10 per extra change | Cumulative |
| **Scandal While Champion** | -10 to -30 (severity dependent) | Variable |
| **Meaningless Vacancy Tournament** | -5 to -15 | 3-6 months |

---

## 3. BELT PROTECTION SYSTEMS

### Ring Sanctity Setting (Promotion-Level)

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **High Ring Sanctity** | Refuse hotshotting, overexposure, shoot chaos unless necessary |
| **Medium** | Balance spectacle with title protection |
| **Low** | Titles used as booking tools, prestige secondary |

### Title Recovery Arcs

Long redemption arcs can slowly repair belt legacy:

| Arc Type | Prestige Recovery | Duration |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Heroic Underdog Champion** | +10 to +20 | 6-12 months |
| **Prestigious Tournament** | +5 to +15 | 1-3 months |
| **Legendary Defense Streak** | +15 to +30 | 12+ months |
| **Cross-Promotion Super Match** | +5 to +15 | Single event |

### Worker "Belt Protector" Trait

Some workers naturally fight to protect title dignity:

| Behavior | Example Workers |
|----------|-----------------|
| Refuses cheap finishes while champion | Bret Hart, Tanahashi |
| Elevates challengers through great matches | Okada, Flair |
| Treats belt as sacred trust | Kobashi, Misawa |
| Career defined by protecting lineage | Triple H (later years), Cena |

---

## 4. PROMOTION REPUTATION EFFECTS

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Unstable Titles** | Lose global prestige; harder to book cross-promotion supermatches |
| **Title Damage History** | Elite workers may refuse to sign if belts are "meaningless" |
| **Repeated Vacancies** | Fan investment in title matches drops |
| **Protected Lineage** | Attracts prestige-conscious workers; boosts recruitment |

---

## 5. SHOOTY TITLE HUMILIATION MATCHES (PRESTIGE KILLERS)

A specific category of damage where booking intentionally or recklessly destroys title meaning through worked shoots, joke matches, or public defacements.

### Humiliation Event Types

| Event | Example | Damage Level |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Worked Shoots on Title Matches** | Hogan vs Jarrett BATB 2000 (lay-down angle gone wrong) | CATASTROPHIC |
| **Joke Title Transfers** | HBK laying down for HHH for Euro Title after burying Bulldog | SEVERE |
| **Fingerpoke of Doom** | Belt swap without real struggle, match quality, or meaning | CATASTROPHIC |
| **Public Belt Defacements** | Throwing away belts, mocking divisions live (WCW Cruiserweight jokes) | SEVERE |

### Immediate Fallout from Humiliation

| Fallout | Simulation Behavior |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Belt Prestige Collapses** | Belts become props in eyes of fans and workers |
| **Worker Disillusionment** | Real locker room morale crashes when belts are seen as jokes |
| **Fanbase Disgust** | Ticket sales, ratings, merch loyalty all decline when stakes vanish |
| **Historical Belt Memory Damage** | Even decades later, belts associated with disasters take time to recover (e.g., WCW World Heavyweight in post-2000s perception) |

### Real World Models Locked

| Real Event | Fallout |
|------------|--------|
| **BATB 2000 Hogan/Jarrett** | WCW political death spiral accelerates |
| **Fingerpoke of Doom** | WCW loses remaining credibility; Nitro ratings collapse |
| **HBK/HHH Euro Belt Farce** | European Title loses meaning; Bulldog's final big push tarnished |
| **Jarrett's TNA King of the Mountain Booking** | Early TNA seen as "Jarrett's vanity fed," trust issues for years |

---

## 6. HISTORICAL EXAMPLES

| Event | Damage Type | Long-Term Effect |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Medusa WWF Women's Title Trash (1995)** | Title Defacement | Belt prestige never fully recovered in that era |
| **Montreal Screwjob** | Champion Walkout Crisis | Title controversy became legendary, not damaging |
| **WCW World Title Hot-Potato (1999-2000)** | Booking Chaos | Belt became meaningless, contributed to company death |
| **ECW Title Legitimacy** | Low Ring Sanctity + Great Workers | Cult prestige despite chaotic booking |
| **IWGP Heavyweight Recovery (2010s)** | Title Recovery Arc | Tanahashi/Okada rebuilt prestige through legendary defenses |
