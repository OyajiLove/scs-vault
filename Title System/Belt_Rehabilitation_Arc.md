# Belt Rehabilitation Arc Mechanics

📛 **NAME:** Belt Rehabilitation Arc Mechanics  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Title System / Prestige Recovery  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** belt, title, rehabilitation, prestige, recovery, tournament, redemption, dignity  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how damaged championships slowly regain dignity and fan belief after prestige collapse. Recovery requires years of emotional arcs, credible champions, and booking culture shifts. No magical resets: players and AI must earn belt prestige back organically.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Belts damaged by shoot humiliations, booking farces, vacancy pandemics require active rehabilitation
- Recovery methods include epic tournaments, heroic title runs, signature feud revivals
- Recovery is slow (2-4 years minimum), affected by promotion trust level and booking patterns
- Media and Fan World Memory records "Belt Dark Era" forever
- Worker careers impacted by holding tainted belts
- Cross-promotion supermatch value reduced until rehabilitation complete

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (deterministic prestige calculations; LLM could generate belt history narratives, commentary on recovery progress)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 166-169 (locked)

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact prestige recovery rates per method
- Minimum reign length for "Heroic Title Run" to count
- How cross-promotion super matches affect recovery rates

## 1. WHEN A BELT NEEDS REHABILITATION

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Shoot Humiliations** | Belt defaced, mocked, hotshotted (Jarrett-Hogan BATB 2000) |
| **Booking Farce** | Joke matches, meaningless reigns (HBK/HHH Euro belt farce, Russo WCW title) |
| **Vacancy Pandemics** | Title stripped multiple times without credible explanation (WCW 2000) |
| **Promotion Trust Collapse** | When fanbase trust is low, ALL belts suffer, even if defended well |
| **Clique Control Belt Hoarding** | Single faction monopolizes title scene with no credible threats (nWo reign bloat) |

---

## 2. REHABILITATION METHODS

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Epic Redemption Tournament** | Brutally hard-fought, logical tournament arc (e.g., G1 Climax, old Crockett Cups) to crown new credible champion |
| **Heroic Title Run** | Worker with high Fan Trust wins belt and embarks on series of meaningful, escalating defenses with real danger, real emotion |
| **Signature Feud Revival** | Belts regain meaning through hot personal feuds, not just technical defenses (e.g., Tanahashi/Okada era saving IWGP memory) |
| **Company Booking Culture Shift** | Titles protected again systemically: no lazy DQs, comedy wins, or shock title changes unless earned |
| **Fanbase Emotional Buy-In** | Fans must feel like belt matters again: pop for near-falls, live/die by title matches, care about who wins |
| **Time Investment** | Belt recovery is slow. One great reign isn't enough: usually needs 2-4 years of emotional arcs stacking |

### Method Effectiveness

| Method | Prestige Recovery | Duration |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Epic Redemption Tournament** | +10 to +20 | 1-3 months (event) |
| **Heroic Title Run** | +15 to +30 | 6-12 months minimum |
| **Signature Feud Revival** | +20 to +40 | 12-24 months |
| **Booking Culture Shift** | +5 to +15 (cumulative) | Ongoing |
| **Cross-Promotion Super Match** | +5 to +15 | Single event |

## 3. DIFFICULTY MODIFIERS

| Modifier | Simulation Effect |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Promotion Fan Trust Level** | Low-trust promotions struggle much harder to rebuild belts |
| **Worker Credibility** | Belt held by workers with low Fan Trust slows recovery (even if they wrestle well) |
| **Booking Pattern** | If lazy booking persists even during rehabilitation attempts (same finishes, no escalation), belts remain tainted |
| **Narrative Weight of Matches** | Emotional storytelling > match quality alone. 45-minute epics without stakes do not rebuild belts. |
| **Real-World Memory of Belt Damage** | If damage was publicly humiliating (e.g., Medusa trashing WWF belt), full recovery may take decades |

### Modifier Scale

| Condition | Recovery Multiplier |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **High Promotion Trust** | 1.5x recovery speed |
| **Medium Promotion Trust** | 1.0x (baseline) |
| **Low Promotion Trust** | 0.5x recovery speed |
| **Cynical/Checked-Out Era** | 0.25x recovery speed |
| **Public Humiliation Memory** | +50% time to full recovery |

---

## 4. SUBTLE SIMULATION IMPACTS

| Impact | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Media and Fan World Memory** | Records the "Belt Dark Era" and references it in later generations' discourse |
| **Worker Career Trajectories** | Holding a tainted belt early hurts careers long-term if belt not cleaned during their reign |
| **Cross-Promotion Supermatch Value** | Tainted belts devalue dream matches until rehabilitated |
| **Recruitment Effects** | Prestige-conscious workers may refuse to sign if main titles are "meaningless" |

---

## 5. HISTORICAL REHABILITATION MODELS

| Event | Recovery Arc |
|-------|--------------|
| **IWGP Heavyweight Belt (post-Kensuke Sasaki dull era)** | Tanahashi, Okada, Naito, Omega series re-legitimize over 10+ years |
| **WWF Title (post-Screwjob, post-Austin rise)** | Austin's era restores belt dignity through clear arcs and anti-corporate rebellion payoff |
| **NWA Belt Post-TNA Split (2002)** | Took decades and Billy Corgan's rebrand to even partially cleanse the title's lost aura |
| **Ring of Honor World Title (Mid-2000s)** | Carefully built prestige through long reigns, pure matches, emotional feuds (Joe, Danielson, Aries) |

### Recovery Timeline Examples

| Belt | Damage Event | Recovery Time | Recovery Method |
|------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **IWGP Heavyweight** | Mid-2000s stagnation | 10+ years | Signature Feud Revival (Tanahashi/Okada) |
| **WWF Championship** | Montreal Screwjob chaos | 1-2 years | Heroic Title Run (Austin) |
| **NWA World Title** | TNA split, Jarrett era | 15+ years | Booking Culture Shift (Corgan rebrand) |
| **ROH World Title** | N/A (built from scratch) | 3-4 years | Epic Tournament + Long Reigns |
| **WCW World Title** | Never recovered | N/A | Company died before rehabilitation possible |

## 6. REHABILITATION ARC STRUCTURE

A successful rehabilitation arc typically follows this pattern:

### Phase 1: Acknowledgment (0-3 months)
- Booking acknowledges belt has lost meaning (implicitly or explicitly)
- Tournament or qualification arc begins
- Clear stakes established

### Phase 2: Foundation (3-12 months)
- Credible champion crowned through legitimate victory
- First meaningful defenses against worthy challengers
- Fans begin to care about match outcomes again

### Phase 3: Legitimization (12-24 months)
- Multiple successful defenses
- Signature feuds develop
- Near-falls become believable again
- Cross-promotion interest returns

### Phase 4: Restoration (24+ months)
- Belt regarded as prestigious again
- Dream matches become valuable
- Historical damage becomes "era that was overcome"
- Worker careers elevated by holding title
