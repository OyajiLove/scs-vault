# Soul Settings System

📛 **NAME:** Soul Settings System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Game Settings / Player Experience  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** soul, settings, modes, difficulty, emotional, sandbox, simulation, tuning  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Player-facing system for tuning how much emotional simulation depth they want to engage with. Three main modes (Full Soul, Partial Soul, No Soul) plus optional granular sliders. Lets players shape their own world while keeping SCS's emotional soul intact for those who want it.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 3 preset modes: Full Soul (all systems), Partial Soul (softer consequences), No Soul (sandbox)
- 6+ optional toggle sliders for fine-tuning
- Does not "dumb down" the simulation, offers engagement choices
- Default: Full Soul for simulation players

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (settings system, not narrative)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 913-917

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- All emotional systems affected by mode selection
- [[Fanbase_Emotional_Climate]] - memory intensity adjustable
- [[Worker_Physical_Emotional_Lingering]] - scar sensitivity adjustable
- [[Booking_Memory_Pressure_System]] - bias strength adjustable

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact slider ranges and effects
- Mid-game mode switching (allowed? consequences?)
- Achievement/leaderboard implications of mode selection

✅ **STATUS:** Locked

## Core Problem

SCS's emotional simulation can overwhelm players looking for a traditional "build your fed" sandbox game. Scars that linger, betrayals that poison for years, fanbases that resent choices, booking memory that doesn't forget mistakes.

This is what makes SCS art, not just simulation. But it's heavy.

**Solution:** Not to gut what makes SCS special. Offer mode toggles that let players engage on their terms, with dignity and clarity, not fake simplification.

## Three Soul Modes ✅ LOCKED

### 🌕 Full Soul Mode (Default for Simulation Players)

All emotional systems enabled:
- Long-term betrayal scars
- Crowd drift
- Booking memory
- Psychological scars
- Cultural rediscovery
- Emotional burnout
- AI books emotionally
- Worker morale not just money-based
- Fans turn on you if you forget who they are

**For players who want to suffer and feel, and earn their world.**

---

### 🌓 Partial Soul Mode (Balanced Sandbox/Storytelling)

Emotional systems exist but with reduced decay, fewer long-term scars, and more forgiveness:
- Fan memory softer
- Betrayals hurt less
- Fatigue fades faster
- Revival arcs more available

**For players who want realism and emotion, but don't want to get trapped by an unforgiving simulation.**

---

### 🌑 No Soul Mode (Creative Sandbox / TEW Replacement)

All emotional systems off:
- Memory = pop + match quality
- Fans don't hold grudges
- Workers are tools, not humans
- Betrayals, deathmatches, and push failures are consequence-free

**For players who want to book matches and build empires without carrying emotional history.**

---

## Optional Modifier Sliders ✅ LOCKED

For even finer tuning, players can individually toggle:

| Slider | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Crowd Memory Intensity** | How long fans remember booking decisions |
| **Betrayal Consequence Duration** | How long betrayal scars affect workers/fans |
| **Psychological Scar Sensitivity** | How easily workers accumulate emotional damage |
| **Emotional Fatigue Speed** | How quickly workers burn out |
| **Media Rediscovery Frequency** | How often nostalgia/documentary waves trigger |
| **Booking Bias Strength** | How much past memory affects AI booking decisions |

Let players shape their own world while keeping SCS's emotional soul intact for those who want it.

## Philosophy

> "SCS can overwhelm players with the emotional weight it simulates. But that's not a problem, it's a sign of depth and seriousness. The solution is not to dumb it down. The solution is to offer clear soul-setting modes so players can choose: how much history they want to carry, how much consequence they can handle, how human they want this world to be."
