# Vol 2 Chunk 05 Extraction

## FINISHED MECHANICS

### Tags System - Master List (385 tags, 11 categories)
**Categories confirmed:**
1. Physical Attributes
2. In-Ring Performance Traits
3. Personality/Backstage Traits
4. Career Trajectory Traits
5. Promo & Media Traits
6. Scandal/Controversy Tags
7. Booking/Promoter Behaviour Tags
8. Fan Perception Tags
9. Special Skills/Liabilities
10. Deathmatch/Hardcore Specializations
11. Era-Specific Adjustments

**Tag Renames (final):**
- "Comeback Machine" → "Career Resurrection Machine" (career arc focus)
- "Monster Comeback Engine" → "Comeback Architect" (in-match comeback sequences)

### Design Decision: No Formal Personality Archetypes
- TEW uses basic archetypes (Arrogant, Cocky, Selfless, Egomaniac, True Professional, etc.)
- SCS decision: Tags are rich enough, no need for separate personality layer
- Tags evolve dynamically; archetypes would cage workers
- Granular tags replace broad archetypes (e.g., Diva Complex, Golden Boy Syndrome, Booking Narcissist instead of just "Arrogant")

### Tag Evolution Theory
- Success pressurizes the soul differently for each worker
- Some stay humble (Consummate Professional remains)
- Some become arrogant (Diva Complex, Booking Narcissist emerge)
- Some break (Fragile Psyche, Self-Destructive Artist)
- Some become political survivors (Political Assassin, Locker Room Kingmaker)
- Rare few stay unchanged (e.g., Darby Allin type: Outsider Icon stays permanent)

### Scandal System Framework

**Severity Tiers:**
1. Minor (drunk photo leaks, cheating)
2. Moderate (DUI charge, backstage fights)
3. Severe (sexual assault, serious abuse)
4. Career Killer (murder, pedophilia)

**Era Sensitivity:**
- 80s: Easier to cover up, no internet
- 90s: Media starts catching, whispers spread
- 00s+: Social media exposes everything, but selective outrage still exists

**Company Protection Mechanics:**
- Big companies shield major stars longer
- Power brokers know and hide scandals internally
- Smaller promotions suffer catastrophic collapse faster
- Institutional rot: corruption bleeds into morale, perception, media relationships

**Real-World Truth Modeled:**
- Pedophilia didn't kill careers (Grizzly Smith, Jerry Lawler examples)
- Big promotions survive scandals (WWE amid Vince/Ace scandals)
- Fans overlook terrible deeds due to loyalty
- Top 1-5% names shielded by management, fans, media bias

### Fan Loyalty Resistance System

**Formula:**
```
Fan Resistance % = (Base Loyalty) + (Star Power Modifier) + (Promotion Size Modifier) - (Scandal Severity Modifier) - (Era Outrage Modifier)
```

**Determines:**
- How fast backlash happens
- How severe pop/merch/sponsor drop is
- Whether scandal "sticks" permanently

**Fanbase Types & Scandal Tolerance:**

| Fanbase Type | Loyalty | Scandal Tolerance | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Hardcore Company Loyalists | Extremely high | High | Unless murder-level bad |
| Indie Hardcore Fans | Medium | Very low | Turn on hypocrites fast |
| Family-Friendly Fans | Medium-high | Very low | Children/drugs/abuse = instant kill |
| Deathmatch Outlaw Fans | Low | Medium-high | Care about authenticity over scandal |
| Lucha Traditionalists | High | Medium | Protect local icons longer |
| Joshi Superfans | High | Low | Purity matters; betrayals devastating |
| Edgy Attitude Era Types | Medium | Medium-high | Love antiheroes, tolerate bad behaviour |

### Career Arc Stages

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Rookie Years | Low pop, basic traits dominate (underdog, green, reckless, hungry) |
| Breakout | Miracle match, angle, or political openings jump cards |
| Fame | Success pressures behavior; some stay humble, some become monsters |
| Physical Decline | Injuries, aging, loss of passion creep in |
| Crisis | Scandals, locker room betrayals, being leapfrogged |
| Reinvention | Some adapt new personas; others cling to old success |
| Retirement Attempts | Some truly leave, some unretire multiple times |
| Legacy | Legends vs. bitter obscurity vs. indie reinvention |

### Scandal Shielding System (outlined)
- Major stars have internal "cover up" chances
- Fanbase loyalty buffers delay/soften backlash
- Earlier eras absorb scandal easier
- Promotion size affects risk (small = catastrophic, large = survivable)
- Redemption bias: high loyalty stars can mount "From the Ashes" comebacks

## HALF-BAKED / IDEAS

### Wrestler Evolution Examples (for future worker profiles)
| Wrestler | Early Tags | Late Tags |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Stone Cold Steve Austin | Fiery Underdog, Solid Hand, Consummate Professional | Booking Narcissist, Big Show Hustler, Ruthless Heat Magnet |
| Darby Allin | Outsider Icon, Pain Legend, Weekend Warrior | Outsider Icon, Pain Legend (unchanged) |
| Shawn Michaels | Prodigy That Peaked Early, Reckless Brawler | Walking Headcase, Booking Martyr, later Redemption Prodigy |
| Bret Hart | True Professional, Match Storyteller | Yapper, Locker Room Sweetheart, Grizzled Ring General |
| Kenny Omega | High-Speed Technician, Flamboyant Loner | Cult of Personality, Dream Match Magnet |

### Institutional Loyalty Sickness
- Loyalty can become sickness (fans protecting abusers)
- Loyalty can finally break (dam bursts after sustained pressure)
- Both outcomes should feel human and messy, not mechanical

## OPEN QUESTIONS

- Exact values for scandal severity penalties?
- How do scandals get hidden vs exposed mechanically?
- Career arc randomizer triggers (injury odds, political betrayal chances)?
- How do promotions attach to fanbase types?
