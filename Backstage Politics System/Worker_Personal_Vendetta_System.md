# Worker Personal Vendetta System

📛 **NAME:** Worker Personal Vendetta System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker System / Backstage Politics  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** vendetta, grudge, betrayal, sabotage, politics, locker room, faction, revenge  
📝 **SUMMARY:** System for how loyalty fractures, betrayals, and perceived injustices create hidden personal vendettas in workers. Vendettas are emotional scars that create backstage sabotage risks, influence booking politics, spark factional warfare, cause match breakdowns, and shape career survival. Vendettas can live quietly for years or erupt into open locker room wars.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 5 triggers: Severe Loyalty Betrayal, Booking Injustice, Backstage Sabotage, Career-Wrecking Injury, Soul Betrayal (promotion drift)
- Personality traits affect vendetta risk: Ego, Paranoia, Drive, Loyalty
- 5 manifestation stages: Quiet Resistance → Factional Splits → Match Sabotages → Public Escalation → Career Sabotage
- Vendettas live invisibly first but shape locker room power webs over years

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (LLM can narrate vendetta formation, describe sabotage incidents, generate political intrigue)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 930-933

## Core Concept

When loyalty fractures, betrayals cut deep, or perceived injustices pile up, workers don't just passively lose morale. Sometimes personal vendettas form.

Vendettas are hidden emotional scars that:
- Create backstage sabotage risks
- Influence booking politics
- Spark factional warfare
- Cause match breakdowns, botches, sandbagging
- Leak political warfare into media indirectly
- Shape career survival (or collapse)

**Vendettas can live quietly for years, or erupt into open locker room wars when conditions align.**

## How Vendettas Are Created ✅ LOCKED

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Severe Loyalty Betrayal** | Close friends, tag teams, stablemates turned on each other in booking or backstage with no emotional closure |
| **Booking Injustice** | Workers buried unjustly (pushed aside for golden children, scapegoated post-scandal) hold silent grudge |
| **Backstage Sabotage** | Political power plays succeed: star wrestlers burying rising talents, match manipulations, sabotage angles |
| **Career-Wrecking Injury** | Workers blaming others (fairly or unfairly) for injuries that destroyed pushes or careers |
| **Soul Betrayal (Promotion Identity Drift)** | Workers emotionally bonded to original soul of promotion feel betrayed when company sells out emotionally (e.g., rebellion fed becoming corporate sellout) |

Vendettas aren't automatic. They form based on personality traits, emotional loyalty levels, betrayal severity, and world climate.

## Personality Traits that Influence Vendetta Risk ✅ LOCKED

| Trait | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **High Ego** | Higher likelihood of taking career insults personally and forming vendettas |
| **High Paranoia** | More likely to perceive betrayal even when unintended, higher vendetta formation chance |
| **High Drive** | More likely to quietly survive and weaponize vendetta into comeback arcs later |
| **Low Loyalty** | May form vendettas but lack emotional follow-through to act on them consistently |

Different workers react differently to the same betrayals.

## How Vendettas Manifest Over Time ✅ LOCKED

| Stage | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **1. Quiet Resistance** | Workers subtly undermine pushes (half-hearted matches, sandbagging, leaking backstage discontent) |
| **2. Factional Splits** | Workers cluster loyalty around vendetta targets, invisible backstage alliances form or harden |
| **3. Match Sabotages** | If booked against vendetta targets, risk of match breakdowns (botches, no-selling, stiffness) increases |
| **4. Public Escalation** | If media starts sniffing rumors, vendettas can leak into public, destabilizing booking even if official stories stay controlled |
| **5. Career Sabotage** | Workers with political allies can sabotage vendetta targets' pushes silently through agents, booking suggestions, locker room whisper networks |

Vendettas live invisibly first but shape locker room power webs deeply over years.

## Real-World Examples

| Example | SCS Behavior |
|---------|--------------|
| **Bret Hart vs Shawn Michaels (Post-1996)** | Mutual vendettas poisoned locker room atmosphere, infected booking memory, climaxed violently |
| **Tetsuya Naito vs NJPW Management (Pre-LIJ)** | Naito's perceived betrayal by management created a silent vendetta arc, rebuilt into rebellion hero |
| **Kawada Loyalty to Baba vs Misawa Exodus** | Deep backstage vendetta emotional drift, altered career arcs for a decade |

**Vendettas aren't just feuds. They are invisible career scars that warp matches, pushes, retirements, and company survival.**
