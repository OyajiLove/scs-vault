# Worker Resistance System

📛 **NAME:** Worker Resistance System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Backstage System / Worker Behavior  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** resistance, pushback, refuse, walkout, sabotage, morale, rebellion, negotiate, locker room  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Wrestlers aren't game pieces. They push back, negotiate, stall, refuse, complain, sabotage, or no-show. Some comply quietly. Others become legends for what they refused to do. Resistance is determined by hidden personality traits, locker room dynamics, booking memory, fan trust, contracts, and cultural context.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 7 trigger types (asked to lose, refused title, bad gimmick, drafted by rival, etc.)
- 8 determining factors (Ego, Loyalty, Drive, Morality, Traditionalism, Paranoia, Fan Memory, Alliances)
- 6 resistance levels from Silent to Walkout
- 5 booking response options with consequences
- Full integration with Vol 1-4 systems

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Very High (LLM can generate resistance dialogue, describe negotiations, narrate walkout drama)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 1094-1102

## Core Idea

Wrestlers aren't game pieces.

They push back. They negotiate, stall, refuse, complain, sabotage, or simply no-show.

Some comply quietly. Others become legends for what they refused to do.

SCS simulates this at every level, influenced by:
- Hidden personality traits
- Locker room dynamics
- Booking memory
- Fan trust
- Contracts, leverage, and reputation
- Cultural context (era, region, promotion)

## When Resistance Can Happen ✅ LOCKED

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Asked to Lose a Match** | "I'm not jobbing in my hometown." |
| **Refused Title Push** | "I've earned this. If you won't give me the belt, I'll walk." |
| **Assigned Bad Gimmick** | "You want me to be a dancing skeleton? I have kids, man." |
| **Drafted by a Rival Fed** | "You sent me where?! I'm not showing up." |
| **Booked to Lose After Big Win** | "You're killing my heat. Fix this." |
| **Worked Too Hard Without Payoff** | "Three match-of-the-year contenders and I'm opening next show? Nah." |
| **Used in a Shoot Angle Without Consent** | "You exposed my scandal on TV? I'm done here." |

**Each case checks memory + emotional logic + contract + personality.**

## What Determines If Resistance Happens ✅ LOCKED

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Ego (hidden stat)** | High = more likely to push back, demand protection, or walk out |
| **Loyalty** | High = might accept a bad hand if they believe in the promotion. Low = gone at first insult. |
| **Drive** | High = may resist being shelved, demand opportunities. Low = disengages or slow-burns rebellion. |
| **Morality** | High = resists scandal-based bookings, betrayal angles, burying friends |
| **Traditionalism** | High = resists experimental booking, intergender matches, comedy arcs |
| **Paranoia** | High = sees betrayal where there is none. Resists changes even if logical. |
| **Fan Reaction Memory** | Workers with hot crowd support feel emboldened. Cold crowd may make even egotists compliant. |
| **Backstage Alliances / Factions / Tags** | Peer pressure, cliques, mentors all influence whether resistance is supported or isolated |
| **Booking Memory** | If you've buried them before, they'll remember. Even years later. |
| **Era / Region / Culture** | 1970s territory guy = more likely to walk out or punch someone. 2010s joshi = may ghost and retire silently. |

## Resistance Levels ✅ LOCKED

| Resistance Type | Behavior |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Silent** | Worker doesn't complain, but checks out. Flat match. Misses cues. Ghosts media events. |
| **Verbal** | Worker complains to booker/agent. May suggest changes. Triggers Booking Committee drama. |
| **Locker Room Uprising** | Resistance spreads through faction, mentor, or clique. Can collapse morale. |
| **Refusal** | Worker outright refuses to do what's asked. May offer an alternative. |
| **Sabotage** | Worker does the match, but buries it. Botches, sandbags, breaks kayfabe. |
| **Walkout / No Show** | "They're gone." May trigger scandal, loss of title, fan revolt, or myth collapse. |

## System Outcomes ✅ LOCKED

| Booking Response | Impact |
|------------------|--------|
| **Give In** | May preserve worker morale. Crowd might see the weakness. Power structure shifts. |
| **Punish Quietly** | Booking changes made backstage. Worker may simmer. Fans may notice. |
| **Shoot Response** | Booker/owner responds on-air or via promo. Risks fan blowback. May be seen as petty or brave. |
| **Firing / Suspension** | Can restore control, or trigger a full locker room revolt. |
| **Scapegoating** | Other workers punished. Clique fractures. Might start loyalty decline spiral. |

**Memory stores who resisted, how management responded, and what story fans told afterward.**

## Examples in SCS Simulation ✅ LOCKED

| Situation | Simulation Result |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Hogan refuses to lose to Kidman | Ego + Fan Memory mismatch = sabotage angle booked, but Kidman's push dies |
| HBK drops European title to HHH in fake match | Locker room demoralized. Midcard collapses. Fans tune out. |
| Worker refuses comedy gimmick in serious fed | If booked anyway, morale tanks. If replaced, push opens for someone else. |
| Worker works shoot into promo without clearance | If promo goes viral, fed may ride the wave. If not, fallout hits hard. |
| Japanese veteran no-shows after being asked to blade for outsider | Media rips fed. Title loses prestige. Faction walks out two weeks later. |

## Player Interaction Options ✅ LOCKED

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Negotiate** | Offer worker a compromise (change finish, time, promo) |
| **Appeal to Loyalty** | Use past push history or mutual respect to calm them down |
| **Threaten** | Risky. Can lead to silent sabotage or scorched earth. |
| **Work Around** | Book angle to write them off or reverse the narrative |
| **Fire / Suspend / Fine** | Drastic, but sometimes necessary. Fans may side with worker. |

**You can soft book to preserve relationships or assert control and risk fracture. Either way, the locker room is watching.**

## Integration with Legacy Systems (Vol 1-4) ✅ LOCKED

### 1. Hidden Personality Traits (Vol. 1)

The foundation of worker resistance is built on Ego, Loyalty, Drive, Morality, Traditionalism, Paranoia.

| Trait | Resistance Effect |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Ego** | High = likely to push back on losses, booking they feel beneath them, or perceived disrespect |
| **Loyalty** | High = more likely to endure hardship or put someone over. Low = quick to walk or sabotage. |
| **Drive** | High = may resist being shelved, demand opportunities. Low = goes quiet or checks out silently. |
| **Morality** | Refuses to participate in sleaze, bury friends, or exploit scandals |
| **Traditionalism** | Refuses comedy gimmicks, intergender, or "disrespecting the sport" angles |
| **Paranoia** | Sees betrayal in normal losses. May resist a clean loss for fear of being buried. |

### 2. Worker Tags (Vol. 2)

Tags modify, amplify, or contextualize resistance.

| Tag | Interaction |
|-----|-------------|
| **Booking Politician** | May feign "concerns" to manipulate push structure. Resistance is subtle but chronic. |
| **Backstage Leader** | May resist bad booking on behalf of others. Stands up to protect others' arcs. |
| **Veteran Traditionalist** | Combines with Traditionalism to cause strong resistance to fed drift |
| **Company Loyalist** | Will often go along with questionable bookings for the good of the brand |
| **Loose Cannon** | Resistance is unpredictable. Might do the angle, then shoot in promo next week. |
| **Legacy Protector** | Refuses to lose clean to "unworthy" talent. Pushes for redemption arcs. |
| **Sandbagger** | Resists through poor performance |
| **Shooter** | Might resist physically |

### 3. Booking Memory & Fan Reaction Memory (Vol. 2-3)

| Interaction | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Booking Memory** | If buried repeatedly, more likely to resist even good booking ("You're only pushing me now that you're desperate.") |
| **Fan Reaction Memory** | If crowd is hot, resistance more likely ("Why would I lose now?"). If cold, may comply to stay relevant. |
| **Myth Drift** | Legend asked to lose to cold midcarder triggers resistance from them AND fan loyalty collapse |
| **Commentary Behavior** | If worker resists and fed buries them on commentary, it shifts narrative heat and impacts fan trust |

### 4. Match Flavor System (Vol. 4)

| Match Flavor | Resistance Risk |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Hardcore / Deathmatch** | Traditionalist or moralist workers may refuse entirely. Sabotage risk high. |
| **Comedy** | "Serious" workers may resist without soul-compatible booking lead-in |
| **Epic** | High-Ego workers may want to extend. May resist being cut short. |
| **Old-School** | Respect-based, workers more likely to comply if booking is justified |
| **Shoot or Gimmick** | May resist if "beneath them," too dangerous, or undermines recent arc |

### 5. Fanbase Drift + Cultural Drift (Vol. 4-5)

| System | Resistance Outcome |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Fanbase Drift** | If fed's direction shifts (joshi fed becoming entertainment-focused), old guard may resist, triggering loyalty fractures |
| **Cultural Drift** | Booking angles that would fly in 1998 might cause moralist workers to resist in 2025. World's values shift. |

## Philosophy

> "SCS Worker Resistance is fully modular, fully emotional, and memory-driven. It's not a gamey 'morale bar,' it's a network of relationships, history, and trust breaking or holding. Matches, angles, scandals, and pushes can collapse if resistance isn't handled wisely. But sometimes? Resistance births the greatest arcs in wrestling history."
