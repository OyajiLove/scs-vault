## Core Concept

> "The booker doesn't work alone. Sometimes they can't. Sometimes they're watched. Sometimes the committee is smarter. Sometimes it's the reason everything dies."

The Booking Committee System models internal power structures that:
- Share power across a committee
- Host internal debates or conflicts
- Make booking a negotiation or battlefield
- Let the player choose their level of control (or submission)

## Committee Types ✅ LOCKED

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Solo Booker (Default)** | One booker with full authority. May consult others but has final say. Committee exists in name only. |
| **Consultative Committee** | Booker makes decisions but committee members influence heavily (advice, push preferences) |
| **Voting Committee** | Every major booking decision requires a vote: title changes, pushes, faction betrayals, signings/firings |
| **Split Committee** | Each member controls a division or roster (juniors, women, heavyweights, tag). Booker oversees arc flow. |
| **Power Vacuum** | No clear head. Votes sway wildly. Clashes frequent. AI feds with this may self-destruct or surprise everyone. |

---

## Booking Agenda Tags ✅ LOCKED

| Tag | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| **Protect My Allies** | Tries to get their clique pushed, avoids booking losses for friends |
| **Soul Defender** | Opposes any story that violates the promotion's emotional identity |
| **Heat Hunter** | Pushes betrayals, hot-shotting, chaos. Wants segments that "go viral." |
| **Company Legacy** | Supports traditional arcs and myth defense. Dislikes edgy storylines. |
| **Locker Room Moralist** | Opposes scandal angles, dirty finishes, or blading |
| **Clique Antagonist** | Opposes another committee member specifically. Will vote against just to block their ideas. |
| **Push Skeptic** | Always wants new stars tested harder. Won't back pushes without crowd proof. |
| **Burnout** | Says little. Often votes "yes" or "whatever." May be replaced or manipulated. |
| **Manipulator** | Cuts private deals. Backs ideas for later leverage. May blackball workers or other committee members. |

## Voting & Power Balance ✅ LOCKED

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Influence Weight** | Not all votes are equal. Booker often has tiebreaker. Owner votes may count x2. Worker votes may be informal unless granted authority. |
| **Persuasion Mechanics** | High Negotiation skill + high Loyalty can swing a vote. Player can negotiate, promise, or threaten depending on personality. |
| **Backstage Memory** | Past betrayals, scandals, or favoritism can cause long-term voting bias. |
| **Disagreement Fallout** | Majority wins = fine. Ties or ignored votes = resentment builds. Losing votes frequently = committee revolt risk. |
| **Faction Influence** | If committee is clique-stacked, booking becomes warped. May cause locker room revolt or fan drift. |

---

## Player Interaction Modes ✅ LOCKED

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Solo Authority** | You overrule the committee. Risk: morale hit, political revolt. |
| **Vote Player** | You cast one vote. Must negotiate, convince, build alliances. |
| **Hidden Hand** | You're not on the committee, but can manipulate votes backstage through relationships, bribes, or public sentiment. |
| **Full Democratic Mode** | Votes dictate all major booking decisions. You live with the outcome. Memory tracks every betrayal or brilliant success. |

---

## World Events from Committee Chaos ✅ LOCKED

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| **Booking Coup** | Committee removes the booker (AI or player). Replaces with new archetype. |
| **Locker Room Walkout** | Poor decisions driven by stacked committee logic break trust. Workers resist, leave, or form rival factions. |
| **Clique Takeover** | Committee becomes faction-controlled. Booking becomes emotionally lopsided. Fan memory begins shifting perception of fed. |
| **Owner Override** | If things spiral, the owner may reset the committee. Risks backlash if loyalists are purged. |

---

## Integration with Other Systems ✅ LOCKED

| System | Connection |
|--------|------------|
| **Booker Archetypes** | Archetype shapes how booker uses or fights committee |
| **Booking Instinct** | High-instinct members make better calls, low-instinct create chaos |
| **Negotiation** | Determines persuasion power in votes |
| **Worker Resistance** | Poor committee decisions trigger pushback |
| **Faction System** | Clique influence can stack committee |
| **Fan Reaction Memory** | Bad committee booking = fan drift |
| **Commentary** | World reacts to booking patterns ("Why does everything end in chaos in this fed?") |

---

## Philosophy

> "The committee isn't just a feature. It's a simulation of how real wrestling promotions actually work: messy, political, emotional, and full of people who think they know better than everyone else. Sometimes they're right. Sometimes they destroy everything."

## Veto Power (Vol 5 line 1163) ✅ LOCKED

| Role | Conditions | Consequences |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Head Booker** | Only if they still hold real power (not just title) | May trigger walkouts, faction drift, or agent sabotage |
| **Owner** | Emergency or culture-driven override | Can collapse locker room trust instantly |
| **Network Rep** | Only in network-influenced feds | "Our guy wins, or the deal dies" ultimatums |

**Vetoing a democratic vote doesn't just end the conversation, it starts a fire that affects morale, perception, and power dynamics.**

> "This was supposed to be Tanahashi's night. You just flushed six months for a shock finish?" — Worker reaction after a veto override

## Freeform Input in Booking Meetings (Vol 5 line 1164) ✅ LOCKED

Players can type dialogue to suggest booking ideas or respond to others in creative meetings, not just pick from presets.

**How It Works:**
- Player can suggest segments, angles, or match logic in real-time using freeform text
- Engine interprets input based on:
  - **Tone** (supportive, egotistical, manipulative, sarcastic)
  - **Booking logic match** (does it align with promotion DNA, worker arcs?)
  - **Respect memory** (does the committee trust your vision?)
  - **Style compatibility** (pitching hardcore to a "soul purist" fed?)

**Committee responds dynamically:**
- Support, resistance, laughter, resentment, cold silence
- Agent interjections and factional bias all kick in

**Example reactions:**
- "You're booking another betrayal? That's three in six weeks."
- "You trying to lose the crowd or win a slap fight on Twitter?"

**Consequence Memory:**
- How you phrase suggestions is remembered
- Burn bridges with passive-aggressive/dismissive language = votes turn against you
- Show strong vision and adaptability = gain soft power, convert rivals

**Committee meetings become interactive narrative hubs, not just voting systems.**
