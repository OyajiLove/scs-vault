# Backstage Politics System

📛 **SYSTEM ID:** POLITICS-001
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Simulation Drama / Locker Room Dynamics
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** politics, power struggle, influence, clique, booking committee, exodus, schism, regime change, locker room
📝 **SUMMARY:** 

The Backstage Politics System simulates the power dynamics, alliances, and conflicts that occur behind the scenes in wrestling promotions. It governs how workers accumulate influence, form cliques, navigate regime changes, and potentially trigger exodus events when internal tensions boil over. This creates emergent drama that affects booking decisions, contract negotiations, and promotion stability.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Workers accumulate "influence" based on position, tenure, relationships, and personality
- Cliques form organically based on personality compatibility and shared interests
- Booking decisions create winners and losers, generating political capital or grievances
- Regime changes (new booker/owner) trigger loyalty cascades and potential departures
- Power struggles can escalate to exodus events (mass departures)
- Hidden Personality archetypes drive political behavior (Backstage Politician vs. Loyal Soldier)

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (generating political maneuvering, grudge narratives, alliance descriptions)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 1-4 (conceptual), AJPW exodus template (Vol 4), Hidden Personality archetypes

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** 
- [[Hidden_Personality|Hidden Personality]] - Archetypes drive political behavior
- [[Faction System/_Faction System Index|Faction System]] - In-ring factions mirror backstage alliances
- [[Contract System/_Contract System Index|Contract System]] - Departures, negotiations, leverage
- [[Morale System|Morale System]] - Political outcomes affect morale
- [[Scandal System/_Scandal System Index|Scandal System]] - Leaks, public disputes
- [[Retirement System/_Retirement System Index|Retirement System]] - Power broker transitions

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Influence calculation formulas
- Clique formation algorithms
- Schism probability triggers
- Booking committee voting mechanics
- Exodus mechanics (who follows whom?)
- Regime change survival probability
- Power broker identification

✅ **STATUS:** Partially Locked (Core power struggle mechanics from Vol 5 now locked)

## Design Philosophy

Wrestling promotions are political entities. Behind the curtain, workers compete for spots, influence creative decisions, and form alliances to protect their positions. The Backstage Politics System models this reality without scripting specific outcomes.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Emergent Drama:** Political events arise from system interactions, not scripts
2. **Personality-Driven:** Hidden Personality archetypes determine political behavior
3. **Consequences Matter:** Political wins and losses compound over time
4. **Realistic Complexity:** No simple good/evil, just competing interests

## Integration Points

**With Hidden Personality:**
- Backstage Politician archetype: High political activity
- Loyal Soldier: Low political activity, follows power
- Bombthrower: Creates chaos, destabilizes regimes
- Ace Complex: Demands political concessions
- Mercenary Soul: Leverages politics for personal gain

**With Faction System:**
- On-screen factions often reflect backstage alliances
- Faction leaders accumulate influence
- Faction dissolution creates political fallout

**With Contract System:**
- Political capital affects negotiation leverage
- Departures trigger loyalty cascades
- Blacklisting as political weapon

**With Morale System:**
- Political defeats lower morale
- Political victories boost confidence
- Regime change uncertainty affects roster-wide morale

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Basic influence tracking, personality-driven behavior
**Phase 2:** Clique formation, power struggle events
**Phase 3:** Full exodus mechanics, regime change simulation
