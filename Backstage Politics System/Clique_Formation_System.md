# Clique Formation System

📛 **NAME:** Clique Formation System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Backstage Politics / Locker Room Dynamics  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** clique, backstage alliance, political camps, locker room, Kliq, power struggle, loyalty, betrayal  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models real-world backstage political alliances (distinct from kayfabe factions). Cliques form after betrayals, power shifts, or cultural crises, and evolve through stages of cold war, open conflict, and resolution. Worker personality traits determine which camp they join.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Cliques are REAL backstage alliances (The Kliq, Bone Street Krew, Elite camp)
- Factions are KAYFABE on-screen groups (nWo, Bullet Club, DX)
- Cliques form organically after betrayal events, booking injustices, or cultural shifts
- Worker personality (Loyalty, Ego, Morality, Drive) determines camp alignment
- Cliques have memory, leadership, strength, morale, and can fracture or absorb
- Conflict progresses through stages: Silent Cold War → Cold Betrayals → Open War → Resolution

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (deterministic personality filtering; LLM could generate political dialogue or leak narratives)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 111-120 (locked)

## TERMINOLOGY (LOCKED)

| Term | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Clique** | Real-world backstage political alliance | The Kliq, Bone Street Krew, Elite camp, Punk camp |
| **Faction** | Kayfabe on-screen storyline group | nWo, Bullet Club, DX, Los Ingobernables |

This distinction is **permanent** in SCS to avoid confusion between storyline and reality layers.

---

## 1. CLIQUE TYPES

| Clique Type | Behavior | Historical Example |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Loyalist Camp** | Stay loyal to original philosophy or betrayed leaders | Bret Hart loyalists post-Screwjob |
| **Opportunist Camp** | Align with new power figures for political capital | HHH/HBK rising post-Screwjob |
| **Silent Survivalists** | Refuse to pick sides publicly, shift based on winner | Midcarders during WCW civil war |
| **Rebel Cells** | Plan exits, breakaway promotions, or storyline revolutions | Benoit/Guerrero/Jericho planning WCW exit |
| **Isolationists** | Disengage, stay neutral, protect personal brand only | Foley-type post-Screwjob |

---

## 2. CLIQUE FORMATION TRIGGERS

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Massive Betrayal Event** | Montreal Screwjob, Brawl Out, company-selling scandals |
| **Locker Room Discontent Peaks** | Booking injustices, abusive management, perceived betrayals |
| **Post-Betrayal Collateral Fallout** | Workers linked to betrayed figures band together |
| **Power Vacuum** | Booker burnout, resignations, owner instability |
| **Cultural/Philosophy Clash** | Traditionalists vs new generation, style conflicts |

---

## 3. CLIQUE FORMATION MECHANICS

| Mechanic | Simulation Behavior |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Worker Personality Filtering** | Loyalty, Morality, Ego, Drive influence which camp workers join |
| **Faction Recruitment Attempts** | Clique leaders actively try to pull neutral/wavering workers |
| **Clique Size Memory** | Promotions track clique sizes and strength for future coups/walkouts |
| **Clique Morale Boost or Rot** | Cliques either strengthen unity or descend into toxic backstabbing |

### Personality → Clique Alignment

| Hidden Stat | Likely Clique Alignment |
|-------------|------------------------|
| High Loyalty + High Morality | Loyalist Camp |
| High Ego + Low Morality | Opportunist Camp |
| Low Loyalty + Low Drive | Silent Survivalist |
| High Drive + Low Loyalty | Rebel Cell |
| High Paranoia + Moderate Ego | Isolationist |

---

## 4. CLIQUE CONFLICT STAGES

| Stage | Effects |
|-------|---------|
| **Silent Cold War** | Cliques exist, professional facade. Political tension slowly rises. |
| **Cold Betrayals** | Booking sabotage (sandbagging, sloppy matches, ghosting angles) between camps |
| **Open War** | Conflict spills public: no-shows, shoot promos, locker room fights, media leaks |
| **Resolution or Fracture** | One clique wins (power consolidation) OR fractures into new promotions/mass exits |

---

## 5. POST-BETRAYAL COLLATERAL FALLOUT (Owen Hart Model)

Workers closely associated with betrayed/ostracized figures face political punishment:

| Condition | Simulation Effect |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Worker linked to betrayed figure | Loyalty, faction ties, family, public support shown |
| Power shifts against that side | New regime views associates as "tainted" or "risks" |
| Star Sabotage | Top stars refuse to put over, sandbag matches, kill pushes |
| Management Retaliation | Gimmick exiles, midcard hell, enforced jobbing streaks |

### Collateral Fallout Effects

| Outcome | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| **Blacklisting from Top Programs** | No main event pushes regardless of talent |
| **Poisoned Booking Trajectory** | Humiliation angles, forced midcard exile |
| **Contract Pressure** | Worse renewals, frozen out until expiry |
| **Forced Heel Turn** | Management books "repentance" by mocking past allies |
| **Silent Supporters** | Underground loyalists may still support (seeds for later redemption) |

### Historical Examples

| Worker | Real-World Example |
|--------|-------------------|
| Owen Hart | Punished for Bret association; derailed Black Hart push; Blue Blazer exile |
| Rick Rude | Left immediately post-Screwjob; position untenable |
| British Bulldog | Jumped ship but injuries and isolation followed |
| Jeff Jarrett | Blackballed by WWE for years after WCW loyalty |

## 6. LOCKER ROOM EMERGENCY RESPONSE

When crisis hits (walkout, injury, scandal mid-show), workers react based on type:

| Worker Type | Likely Behavior |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Company Loyalists** | Step up voluntarily, work double duty, improvise angles |
| **Opportunists** | Politic for better card placement, title matches |
| **Chaos Agents** | Stir panic, spread rumors, agitate factions |
| **Cynical Veterans** | Refuse extra work unless paid bonus or promised storyline |
| **Protective Mentors** | Shield younger workers from scapegoating |
| **Cowards/Risk-Averse** | Vanish from sight to avoid blame |

### Crisis Outcome Ranges

| Locker Room Behavior | Show Result |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Heroic Rally | Fans sense authenticity, show becomes legendary |
| Disorganized Mess | Card reshuffles bomb, crowd dies, splits deepen |
| Political Coup Begins | Opportunists gain power, new factions form |
| Silent Collapse | Quiet resentment, future unity suffers |

---

## 7. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Event | SCS Application |
|-------|-----------------|
| **WWF Post-Screwjob** | Loyalists (Bret's friends) vs Opportunists (DX) vs Silent Types (Undertaker) |
| **WCW 1996-1999** | NWO Loyalists (Hogan) vs WCW Loyalists (Sting, DDP) vs Survivalists (Jericho, Benoit) |
| **AEW Brawl Out Era** | Elite camp vs Punk camp vs Silent Workers (Danielson peacekeeping) |
| **Stampede 1980s** | Worker revolt against poor pay leads to territory collapse |
