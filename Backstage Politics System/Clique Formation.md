## Overview

Cliques are informal backstage alliances that form organically based on personality compatibility, shared interests, and mutual benefit. Unlike on-screen factions, cliques operate behind the curtain, influencing booking decisions, protecting members, and sometimes destabilizing promotions.

---

## LOCKER ROOM FACTION FORMATION (#111)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #111

**Core Concept:** Just like stables in the ring, backstage factions form organically based on relationships.

### Relationship Types Detected

| Type | Description | Detection Method |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Family** | Blood, marriage | Known data |
| **Friends/Allies** | Based on factions, backstage cliques, ride partners | Behavior tracking |
| **Romantic** | If public info available | Media, known relationships |
| **Rivalry/Hatred** | Shoot references, backstage incidents | Event tracking |
| **Loyalty** | Trainer, mentor, promoter, dojo loyalty | Training history |

### Relationship Strength Scale

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Shallow** | Acquaintances, polite but not invested |
| **Moderate** | Friends, will support but not at great cost |
| **Deep** | True allies, will sacrifice for each other |

### Event-Driven Updates

Relationships evolve through gameplay events:

| Event | Relationship Effect |
|-------|--------------------|
| Betrayal during contracts | -50 to -80 relationship |
| Helping injured friend | +20 to +40 relationship |
| Booking ally poorly | -10 to -30 relationship |
| Booking enemy poorly | +10 to +20 from allies |
| Romantic collapse | Scandal trigger, -100 relationship |

**Triangle Example:** Edge/Lita/Matt Hardy situation creates:
- Edge-Lita: Deep (romantic), then scandal
- Matt-Edge: Deep (friendship), then -100 (betrayal)
- Matt-Lita: Deep (romantic), then -100 (betrayal)
- Locker room split: Some side with Matt, others neutral

## CLIQUE POWER SYSTEM (#123)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #123

**Core Concept:** Veteran groups who quietly (or loudly) control booking, bury outsiders, or protect their own.

### Clique Power Actions

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Vote for/against pushes** | Influence booking committee decisions |
| **Poison the ear of booker** | Reduce target's push priority |
| **Protect members from burial** | Clique members harder to demote |
| **Target outsiders for humiliation** | Political burial of non-members |

### Backstage Political Tags

| Tag | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **Locker Room Poison** | Causes morale drain, creates factions |
| **Locker Room Glue** | Helps resolve tension, keeps morale up |
| **Shit-Stirrer** | Plants rumors, fuels resentment |
| **Backstage Bully** | Intimidates, hazes lower card/rookies |

### Clique Member Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Protection** | Clique shields member from being buried |
| **Burial Power** | Can bury others politically |
| **Contract Leverage** | Clique support influences negotiations |
| **Information Network** | Early warning on booking plans |
| **Exit Difficulty** | Leaving clique creates enemies |

**Locked Example:** "A tag team split poisoned a locker room"
- Team breakup creates faction split
- Workers choose sides
- Morale across roster affected
- Booking becomes political minefield

## Clique vs. Faction Distinction

| Aspect | Clique (Backstage) | Faction (On-Screen) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Visibility** | Hidden from fans | Part of storyline |
| **Purpose** | Political power | Entertainment/booking |
| **Formation** | Organic | Booked |
| **Dissolution** | Personality conflicts | Storyline decisions |
| **Membership** | Invitation-based | Booked by creative |
| **Example** | The Kliq (1995) | nWo (1996) |

**Note:** Cliques may become factions (Kliq → nWo) and factions may develop into cliques (spending time together creates genuine bonds).

## Clique Formation Triggers

### Compatibility Factors

| Factor | Compatibility Boost |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Similar archetypes** | High (Ace Complex attracts Ace Complex) |
| **Complementary archetypes** | Medium (Ace Complex + Loyal Soldier) |
| **Shared training background** | High (same dojo, same trainer) |
| **Similar career phase** | Medium (young workers bond, veterans bond) |
| **Shared grievances** | Very High (mutual enemy unites) |
| **Travel partners** | Medium (time together builds bonds) |
| **Similar styles** | Low-Medium (common ground) |

### Formation Algorithm (Conceptual)

```
Clique Probability = 
  (Personality Compatibility × 0.3) +
  (Shared Background × 0.2) +
  (Mutual Interest × 0.3) +
  (Opportunity × 0.2)
```

**Opportunity Factors:**
- Extended road trips together
- Same programs/feuds
- Shared locker room (tag teams, stables)
- Both new to promotion at same time
