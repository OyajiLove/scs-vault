# SCHEME DISCOVERY & INFORMANT NETWORK SYSTEM

📛 **NAME:** Scheme Discovery & Informant Network  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Backstage Politics, Worker Agency, Locker Room Dynamics  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** snitching, informants, road agents, locker room standing, scheme exposure, backstage politics, worker relationships, intervention, blackmail, leverage, dirtsheets, whistleblowing  
📝 **SUMMARY:**

When workers scheme (refuse jobs, politic for spots, negotiate with rivals, sabotage peers), they don't operate in a vacuum. Other workers, road agents, and locker room informants may discover the scheme before it succeeds. Whether they REPORT it depends on their own relationships, motivations, personality, locker room atmosphere, and assessment of the schemer's value. This creates a counterbalance to the Shoot Betrayal system and makes locker room management meaningful beyond morale.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Schemes have a discovery window before resolution
- Discovery chance based on: scheme type visibility, schemer personality, emotional state, time duration, witness pool size
- Weekly discovery rolls compound over time (small chances snowball)
- Informants are NOT passive snitch-bots; they make decisions based on their own personality and relationships
- Informant decision tree: Snitch (to booker or dirtsheets) / Intervene / Ignore / Co-Sign / Leverage
- Locker room atmosphere modifies all informant behavior (harmonious = internal handling, fractured = leaking normalized)
- Intervention adds a "talk them down" phase where respected veterans can stop schemes
- Player receives warnings if scheme is exposed to them, enabling counter-play
- If NOT exposed, scheme resolves and player deals with consequences
- Criminal schemes and whistleblowing operate on separate tracks with different moral weight

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes, HIGH. LLM can generate:
- Informant reasoning ("I like the kid but he's gonna burn himself")
- Intervention dialogue (veteran talks down hothead)
- Snitch reports to booker with personality flavor
- Schemer response to intervention attempts
- Blackmail/leverage confrontations
- Whistleblower dilemmas

📌 **ORIGIN:** Developed in Claude conversation (Dec 2024), building on Vol 4 backstage politics concepts. Calibrated through historical examples (Montreal Screwjob, Hogan/WCW politicking, Plane Ride From Hell, AEW Brawl Out, Ring Boy Scandal, Vince allegations). Not extracted from original volumes but consistent with Hidden Personality and Agent AI design philosophy.

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- **HIDE-001: Hidden Personality** - Schemer's Ego/Loyalty/Paranoia drives scheme initiation and detectability
- **SCHEME-001: Shoot Betrayal System** - Parent system; this is the COUNTER-system
- **REL-001: Relationship System** - Informant-to-schemer and informant-to-booker relationships determine response
- **MORALE-001: Morale System** - Booker's locker room standing affects discovery network; locker room atmosphere is key modifier
- **AGENT-001: Road Agent System** - Agents as primary intelligence source (embedded vs stooge distinction)
- **POLITICS-001: Backstage Politics** - Broader power struggle context
- **CATA-001: Catastrophic Events** - Criminal schemes escalate to this system
- **WHIST-001: Whistleblowing** - Crimes with victims trigger separate moral track

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- None critical. System is code-ready. Minor refinements expected during playtesting.

✅ **STATUS:** CODE-READY (All formulas calibrated, all values specified)

---

## FORMULA 1: SCHEME DETECTABILITY

How visible is this scheme to potential witnesses?

```
Scheme_Detectability = Base_Type_Visibility × Personality_Modifier × Emotional_State_Modifier

Capped at 1.0
```

### Base_Type_Visibility

Use value from Scheme Types tables above. Range: 0.2 to 0.95

### Personality_Modifier

| Trait | Multiplier | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Loudmouth (Ego 17+) | ×2.0 | Can't help bragging, vents openly |
| High Ego (15-16) | ×1.5 | Talks too much but some restraint |
| Average (10-14) | ×1.0 | Baseline discretion |
| Careful (Paranoia 15-16) | ×0.6 | Watches their back, picks moments |
| Very Careful (Paranoia 17+) | ×0.5 | Assumes everyone's watching |
| Backstage Politician archetype | ×0.8 | Knows how to move in shadows |

*Note: If multiple modifiers apply, multiply together.*

### Emotional_State_Modifier

| State | Multiplier | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Calm/calculated | ×1.0 | Thinking clearly |
| Frustrated | ×1.3 | Venting more, less careful |
| Heated/impulsive | ×1.7 | Not thinking about who hears |
| Raging (just found out bad news) | ×2.5 | Screaming in gorilla, don't care who knows |

### Examples

**Loudmouth hothead (Ego 17) sandbagging in a heated moment:**
```
0.8 × 2.0 × 1.7 = 2.72 → capped at 1.0
```
Near guaranteed someone notices.

**Paranoid politician (Paranoia 17) quietly negotiating with rival promotion:**
```
0.3 × 0.5 × 1.0 = 0.15
```
15% base detectability. Hard to catch.

---

## FORMULA 2: POOL GENERATION

Who COULD potentially witness this scheme?

```
Pool_Size = Base_Pool × Scheme_Duration_Modifier × Schemer_Discretion_Modifier
```

### Base_Pool

| Scheme Type | Pool Size | Who's In It |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Going into business (in ring) | 5-10 | Agents, opponent, gorilla crew, anyone watching monitor |
| Sandbagging | 3-6 | Agents, opponent, practice partners |
| Poisoning the well | 2-8 | Whoever schemer vents to + overhears |
| Politicking to management | 1-4 | Office adjacents, people who notice visits |
| Negotiating with rivals | 0-2 | Close confidants only |
| Leaking to dirtsheets | 0-1 | Almost nobody unless schemer brags |

*Use closest match for scheme types not listed.*

### Scheme_Duration_Modifier

| Duration | Multiplier | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Instant (same day) | ×0.5 | Montreal Screwjob: tiny window, locked circle |
| Days | ×1.0 | Baseline |
| Weeks | ×1.5 | More touchpoints, more chances to slip |
| Months | ×2.5 | Hard to keep secrets that long, pool expands |

### Schemer_Discretion_Modifier

| Trait | Multiplier | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Loudmouth (Ego 17+) | ×2.0 | Pool explodes, everyone hears |
| Careless (Ego 15-16) | ×1.5 | More people than necessary know |
| Average | ×1.0 | Baseline |
| Careful (Paranoia 15+) | ×0.6 | Tight circle, need-to-know |
| Meticulous (Politician + Paranoia 15+) | ×0.4 | Minimal exposure, professional |

### Examples

**Loudmouth running a politicking campaign for two months:**
```
Base: 3 people
Duration: ×2.5 (months)
Discretion: ×2.0 (loudmouth)

3 × 2.5 × 2.0 = 15 potential witnesses
```

**Paranoid politician making one quiet call to a rival:**
```
Base: 1 person (maybe)
Duration: ×0.5 (instant)
Discretion: ×0.4 (meticulous)

1 × 0.5 × 0.4 = 0.2 → round to 0 (effectively no pool)
```

---

## FORMULA 3: WEEKLY DISCOVERY ROLL

For each person in pool, do they notice this week?

```
Weekly_Discovery_Chance = Base_Rate × Detectability × Witness_Awareness + Agent_Bonus
```

### Base_Rate

**0.05 to 0.10 (5-10%)** per week, all things average.

Small but compounds over time. Rewards quick decisive schemes, punishes drawn-out politicking.

### Witness_Awareness

| Type | Multiplier | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Actively suspicious of schemer | ×2.0 | Looking for it |
| Generally observant (road agent, vet) | ×1.5 | Seen it all before, notices patterns |
| Average | ×1.0 | Baseline |
| Self-absorbed (high ego, own problems) | ×0.7 | Not paying attention to others |
| Oblivious (low awareness, green) | ×0.5 | Doesn't know what to look for |

### Agent_Bonus (flat addition if witness is road agent)

| Agent Type | Flat Bonus | Rationale |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| Embedded with the boys | +0.10 to +0.15 | Trusted, boys talk freely around them |
| Management stooge | +0.0 | Boys clam up, hide things |
| Despised stooge | -0.05 | Boys actively work around them, extra careful |

### Examples

**Average witness, average scheme, average week:**
```
0.075 × 0.5 × 1.0 = 3.75% chance this person notices this week
```

**Observant veteran watching a loudmouth sandbag:**
```
0.075 × 1.0 (capped detectability) × 1.5 = 11.25% per week
```

**Embedded road agent watching same loudmouth:**
```
0.075 × 1.0 × 1.5 + 0.125 = 23.75% per week
```

---

## FORMULA 4: CUMULATIVE DISCOVERY OVER TIME

```
Per_Witness_Cumulative = 1 - (1 - Weekly_Chance)^Weeks

Any_Discovery = 1 - ∏(1 - Individual_Cumulative) for all witnesses
```

Small weekly chances snowball. Larger pools multiply opportunities.

### Examples

**3 witnesses, 5% weekly chance, 8 weeks:**
```
Per witness: 1 - (0.95)^8 = 33.7%
Any discovery: 1 - (0.663)^3 = 70.8%
```

**10 witnesses, 10% weekly chance, 4 weeks:**
```
Per witness: 1 - (0.90)^4 = 34.4%
Any discovery: 1 - (0.656)^10 = 98.3%
```

### Design Implication

- Instant schemes (Montreal): low discovery
- Month+ schemes (Hogan politicking): near guaranteed discovery
- Scheme duration is a meaningful tactical choice

## FORMULA 8: INTERVENTION SUCCESS

When someone tries to talk the schemer down.

```
Intervention_Success = Base_Success × Respect_Modifier × Ego_Modifier × Commitment_Modifier

Capped at 0.90 (never guaranteed)
```

### Base_Success

**0.50 (50%)**

### Respect_Modifier (how much schemer respects intervener)

| Respect Level | Multiplier |
|---------------|------------|
| Deeply respected mentor | ×1.6 |
| Respected veteran | ×1.4 |
| Peer/equal | ×1.0 |
| Neutral | ×0.8 |
| Disrespected | ×0.4 |

### Ego_Modifier (schemer's ego)

| Ego | Multiplier |
|-----|------------|
| Low (under 10) | ×1.4 |
| Moderate (10-14) | ×1.2 |
| High (15-16) | ×0.8 |
| Very High (17+) | ×0.5 |

### Commitment_Modifier (how far along is the scheme)

| Stage | Multiplier |
|-------|------------|
| Early (just planning) | ×1.4 |
| Mid (in motion) | ×1.0 |
| Late (committed, invested) | ×0.6 |
| Point of no return | ×0.2 |

### Examples

**Respected veteran on moderate ego young worker, early scheme:**
```
0.50 × 1.4 × 1.2 × 1.4 = 1.176 → capped at 0.85
```
~85% success.

**Peer on high ego committed schemer, late stage:**
```
0.50 × 1.0 × 0.5 × 0.6 = 0.15
```
15% success.

## FORMULA 9: EDGE CASE MODIFIERS

### Target is Beloved Locker Room Leader

Discovery chance: **+40-50%**

People protect the locker room dad. More eyes watching his back.

### Schemer IS the Beloved Locker Room Leader

Discovery chance: **-40-50%**

Who's gonna tell on Taker? Fear factor + genuine loyalty = chilling effect.

### Schemer Has Management Protection (Hogan/Bischoff)

Snitch-to-booker effectiveness: **Variable by informant awareness**

| Informant Awareness | Response |
|---------------------|----------|
| Naive/optimistic | Snitches to management anyway, gets ignored |
| Cautiously hopeful | Snitches, might plant seeds of doubt |
| Cynical/savvy | Goes straight to dirtsheets |
| Defeated | Why bother, ignores entirely |

Locker room learns over time. Early snitches get ignored, behavior shifts toward dirtsheets or giving up.

### Multiple Independent Witnesses

| Atmosphere | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| Harmonious | Likely coordinate before acting ("What do we do?") |
| Fractured | Act independently, may race to snitch first |

---

## FAILED INTERVENTION FALLOUT

### Relationship Damage by Schemer Ego

| Schemer Ego | Relationship Damage | Rationale |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Low (under 10) | -5 to -10 | Feels bad but not offended |
| Moderate (10-14) | -10 to -15 | Annoyed but respects the attempt |
| High (15-16) | -20 to -25 | Insulted you doubted them |
| Very High (17+) | -30 to -40 | How dare you, enemy territory |

### Detectability Change After Failed Intervention

| Schemer Paranoia | Detectability Change |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Low (under 10) | -5% (minor adjustment) |
| Moderate (10-14) | -10% (more careful now) |
| High (15-16) | -20% (significant lockdown) |
| Very High (17+) | -30% (full paranoid mode) |

### Potential Retaliation

| Schemer Personality | Retaliation Chance | Type |
|---------------------|-------------------|------|
| Low ego, non-vindictive | 5-10% | Avoidance only |
| Moderate ego | 15-20% | Spread rumors, minor politicking |
| High ego | 30-40% | Active counter-scheme |
| Vindictive trait | +20% | Added to existing enemies |

---

## LEVERAGE MECHANICS

### Leverage Secrecy Status

| Status | Leverage Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Secret (only informant knows) | Full leverage |
| Rumored (dirtsheets suspect, unconfirmed) | Partial leverage (confirmation still has value) |
| Public (everyone knows) | Zero leverage |

**Critical Rule:** Leverage requires secrecy. Once public, leverage evaporates regardless of severity.

### Leverage Expiration (If Unused)

| Leverage Severity | Expiration |
|-------------------|------------|
| Minor (small rule break, being late) | 4-6 weeks |
| Moderate (refused job, mild politicking) | 3-6 months |
| Severe (active sabotage, secret negotiations) | 1-2 years |
| Nuclear (career-ending if exposed) | Indefinite |
| Criminal | Indefinite (or statute of limitations) |

### Leverage Usage Limits

| Severity | Uses Allowed |
|----------|--------------|
| Minor | One favor, debt cleared |
| Moderate | 2-3 favors over time |
| Severe | Ongoing leverage until relationship breaks |
| Nuclear/Criminal | Lifetime leash (while secret) |

### Favor Types

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Career** | Job to me, support my push, put me over |
| **Political** | Back me in disputes, vote my way, endorse me |
| **Scheme assistance** | Help my scheme, sabotage my enemy |
| **Protection** | Stay out of my business, don't work against me |
| **Humiliation** (enemies) | Public apology, embarrassing stipulation match |

### Refusal Consequences

When schemer refuses leverage demand, informant can:

| Response | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| Snitch immediately | Bombthrower, low patience |
| Escalate demands | Backstage Politician, calculated |
| Wait and try again | Patient, strategic |
| Expose with amplification ("and they refused to make it right") | Vindictive, maximum damage |
| All of the above | Depends on personality |

### Buying Out Leverage

| Condition | Buyout Possible? |
|-----------|------------------|
| Friend holding leverage | Yes, meaningful gesture can clear debt |
| Neutral holding leverage | Maybe, requires substantial payment |
| Enemy holding leverage | Rarely, they want you squirming |
| Criminal leverage | Almost never (stakes too high) |

### Schemer Preemptive Confession

| Confession Completeness | Effect on Leverage |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Full confession | Leverage nullified |
| Partial confession | Reduced, "but did they tell you about THIS part?" |
| Confession to wrong party | May not help, depends on who has leverage |

**Note:** Informant may retaliate for losing their power move.

---

## CO-SIGN EFFECTS

### Leadership After Co-Sign

| Condition | Who Leads |
|-----------|-----------|
| Default | Original schemer stays lead |
| Co-signer has much higher Ego (17+ vs 14-) | Co-signer may take over |
| Co-signer has much higher Backstage Influence | Co-signer may take over |
| Hogan joins your scheme | It's Hogan's scheme now |

### Detectability Change

Average the discretion modifiers:
```
New_Detectability = (Original_Detectability + Co-Signer_Detectability) / 2
```

Careful politician joining loudmouth helps. Loudmouth joining careful schemer hurts.

### Pool Size Change

```
Pool_Addition = Co-Signer_Pool × 0.6 (40% overlap assumed)
New_Pool = Original_Pool + Pool_Addition
```

### Exposure Distribution

| Condition | Exposure |
|-----------|----------|
| Witness only knows one participant | Only that person exposed |
| Both exposed | Lead schemer takes primary blame |
| Co-signer is more visible/loud | They may take more heat |

---

## DIRTSHEET LEAK CONSEQUENCES

### Who Suffers Damage

| Party | Damage Type |
|-------|-------------|
| Schemer | Direct reputation hit |
| Promotion | "Can't control their house" reputation hit |
| Co-signers | Only if specifically named |
| Target (if applicable) | Collateral (story involves them) |

### Reputation Damage Values

| Severity | Base Damage |
|----------|-------------|
| Minor (late to shows, complained in catering) | -5 to -10 |
| Moderate (refused job, politicking) | -15 to -25 |
| Severe (sabotage, rival negotiations) | -30 to -45 |
| Nuclear (expose business, financial fraud) | -50 to -70 |

### Reputation Modifier by Current Standing

| Current Reputation | Damage Multiplier |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Squeaky clean (80+) | ×1.5 (bigger fall) |
| Average (40-79) | ×1.0 |
| Already problematic (<40) | ×0.75 ("what else is new") |

### Reputation Recovery

| Original Severity | Monthly Recovery (Clean Behavior) |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Minor | +3 to +5 |
| Moderate | +2 to +3 |
| Severe | +1 to +2 |
| Nuclear | +0.5 to +1 (near permanent stain) |

**Active Rehabilitation Bonus:** Doubles recovery rate while active (public apology, demonstrably changed behavior). Requires 3+ months sustained effort. Derailed by new incidents.

### Contract Value Impact

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Market value | Reduced (other promotions wary) |
| Current promotion | Push reconsidered |
| Future negotiations | Leverage reduced |

---

## MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS SCHEMES

### Can One Worker Run Multiple Schemes?

Yes, but with penalties:

| Number of Schemes | Detectability Modifier |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | ×1.0 (baseline) |
| 2 | ×1.3 per scheme |
| 3+ | ×1.5 per scheme |

**Backstage Politician archetype:** Reduced penalty (×1.15 / ×1.25)

### Witness in Multiple Pools

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| In multiple pools | Rolls for each independently |
| Attention split | -10% awareness per additional scheme |
| Personal stakes | Prioritizes schemes affecting them directly |

### Two Schemers Discover Each Other

| Relationship | Likely Outcome |
|--------------|----------------|
| Already allies | Potential merger, mutual protection |
| Neutral | MAD standoff, possible alliance, possible mutual leverage |
| Enemies | Race to expose, or mutual blackmail |

---

## SCHEMER COUNTERMEASURES

### Reducing Pool

| Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Limit who they tell | Directly reduces base pool |
| Vary locations/times | -10 to -20% pool discovery |
| Use intermediaries | Adds layer of protection |

### Identifying Potential Informants

| Method | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| High Paranoia (15+) | Watches everyone, -10% discovery chance |
| Backstage Politician | Knows the game, can predict who's dangerous |
| Relationship knowledge | Enemies are obvious threats |

### Buying Silence

| Condition | Buyable? |
|-----------|----------|
| Self-Interested witness | Yes, for a price |
| Timing | Before discovery preferred, after discovery expensive |
| Side effect | Bribe itself becomes leverage material |
| Price factor | Witness moral flexibility × scheme severity |

### Misdirection

| Tactic | Skill Check | Effect if Successful |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Feed false information | Paranoia + Intelligence | Suspected informants chasing wrong lead |
| Frame someone else | Politician archetype | Heat goes to wrong person |
| Create alibi | Varies | Plausible deniability |

## ATMOSPHERE DRIFT

### Atmosphere Accumulator (0-100)

| Range | Atmosphere |
|-------|------------|
| 0-25 | Harmonious |
| 26-50 | Neutral |
| 51-75 | Fractured |
| 76-100 | Toxic |

### Event Impact on Accumulator

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Minor grievance (unfair booking, small slight) | +1 to +3 |
| Moderate incident (public argument, scheme discovered) | +5 to +10 |
| Major incident (brawl, mass leak, popular worker fired) | +15 to +25 |
| Nuclear incident (Brawl Out level) | +30 to +50 |
| Good booking, fair treatment (per month sustained) | -2 to -4 |
| Unifying event (new star, invasion, shared enemy) | -10 to -20 |
| Toxic element removed (problem worker fired) | -5 to -15 |

### Resilience by Current State

| Current State | Resistance to Worsening | Resistance to Improving |
|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Harmonious | ×1.5 (harder to damage) | ×0.75 (easier to maintain) |
| Neutral | ×1.0 | ×1.0 |
| Fractured | ×0.75 (easier to damage further) | ×1.5 (harder to fix) |
| Toxic | ×0.5 (already bad) | ×2.0 (very stuck) |

---

## WHISTLEBLOWING TRACK

When informant discovers criminal behavior WITH A VICTIM, the system shifts from snitching/leverage to whistleblowing.

### Trigger Condition

```
IF Scheme_Type = Criminal
  AND Victim_Exists = True
  → Whistleblowing track (separate from leverage calculus)
```

### Whistleblower Dilemma

| Approach | Evidence Weight | Career Risk | Believability |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Anonymous tip to police | Low | Low | "Unverified source" |
| Anonymous tip to media | Low-Medium | Low | "Anonymous allegations" |
| Named report to police | High | High | Taken seriously |
| Named report to media | Very High | Very High | "Accuser goes public" |
| Lawsuit | Maximum | Maximum | Legal discovery |

### Power Differential Effect

| Accused Power Level | Believability Modifier |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Jobber/low card | Believed easily |
| Midcard | Moderate scrutiny |
| Main eventer | "He said/she said" |
| Locker room leader | Industry closes ranks |
| Management | Active suppression |
| Owner | Near impossible without overwhelming evidence |

### Corroboration Mechanics

```
Accusation_Weight = Base_Evidence × (1 + (Additional_Accusers × 0.5)) × Era_Modifier × (1 / Power_Level)
```

One accuser vs monster = usually loses.
Multiple accusers = tide turns.

### Whistleblower Decision Factors (AI)

```
Factors increasing likelihood:
  + High morality
  + Close relationship to victim
  + Secure career position
  + Post-#MeToo era
  + Others also know (safety in numbers)
  + Community-Minded personality

Factors decreasing likelihood:
  + Fear of retaliation
  + Financial dependence on accused/promotion
  + NDA/legal threats
  + High Traditionalism ("don't air dirty laundry")
  + Victim asked them not to
  + Benefits from accused's success
```

## PROCESSING TIERS (HARDWARE SCALING)

### Tier 1: Potato Mode (low-end mobile, old laptops)

- Your company: Full simulation
- Everyone else: Event tables only (periodic "something happened" from weighted random)
- Processing: During load screens or save points

### Tier 2: Standard (average phone, decent PC)

- Your company: Full simulation
- Rivals/watched (3-5): Medium simulation (schemes exist, simplified discovery)
- Everyone else: Event tables
- Processing: Light background during menus

### Tier 3: Beefy (good PC, high-end phone)

- Your company: Full simulation
- Rivals/watched (5-10): Full simulation
- Major promotions (10-20): Medium simulation
- Everyone else: Event tables with granularity
- Processing: Continuous background

### Tier 4: War Machine (enthusiast hardware)

- Full simulation everywhere
- Detailed informant trees for all companies
- Processing: Let it cook

### User Control

Auto-detect hardware, recommend tier, allow override. Some users prefer richer simulation over performance.

## COMPLETE CALCULATION ORDER

```
1. SCHEME INITIATED
   └── Determine scheme type, schemer personality, emotional state

2. CALCULATE DETECTABILITY (Formula 1)
   └── Base × Personality × Emotional State (cap at 1.0)

3. GENERATE WITNESS POOL (Formula 2)
   └── Base Pool × Duration × Discretion

4. WEEKLY LOOP (for each week scheme runs)
   │
   ├── For each witness in pool:
   │   └── Roll Weekly Discovery (Formula 3)
   │   └── Track cumulative chance (Formula 4)
   │
   └── Check if pool expands (schemer sloppiness, new confidants, co-signers)

5. FOR EACH WITNESS WHO DISCOVERS:
   │
   ├── Check: Is this criminal with victim?
   │   └── YES → Whistleblowing track
   │   └── NO → Continue normal flow
   │
   ├── Calculate Base Action Weights (Formula 5)
   ├── Apply Relationship to Schemer modifier
   ├── Apply Relationship to Booker modifier
   ├── Apply Locker Room Atmosphere modifier (Formula 6)
   ├── Apply Informant Personality modifier (Formula 7)
   ├── Apply Edge Case modifiers (Formula 9)
   │
   └── Roll weighted action

6. RESOLVE ACTION
   │
   ├── If INTERVENE:
   │   ├── Calculate success (Formula 8)
   │   ├── Success → Scheme abandoned
   │   └── Failure → Apply fallout (relationship damage, detectability change, retaliation check)
   │
   ├── If SNITCH TO BOOKER:
   │   └── Player receives warning, can counter-play
   │
   ├── If SNITCH TO DIRTSHEETS:
   │   └── Apply reputation damage, contract impact
   │
   ├── If LEVERAGE:
   │   └── Store leverage (severity determines duration and uses)
   │
   ├── If CO-SIGN:
   │   └── Merge schemes (recalculate leadership, detectability, pool)
   │
   └── If IGNORE:
       └── No effect, scheme continues

7. SCHEME RESOLUTION
   │
   ├── If stopped (intervention, exposure): Scheme fails
   │
   └── If not stopped: Execute success effects from Scheme Types table

8. POST-RESOLUTION
   └── Update relationships, reputation, atmosphere accumulator as needed
```

## PLAYER OPTIONS UPON WARNING

When informant snitches to booker:

| Option | Effect | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Confront directly** | May stop scheme, shows you know | Tips them off, may deny/escalate |
| **Quietly counter-book** | Neutralize without confrontation | Schemer may not know why plans failed |
| **Set a trap** | Let scheme proceed, catch in act | Stronger evidence, higher drama |
| **Fire preemptively** | Nuclear option | Locker room heat, may seem paranoid |
| **Ignore warning** | See what happens | Informant may be wrong/exaggerating |
| **Talk to schemer's allies** | Build coalition | May expose your intel source |

- **Scheme:** Vince + HBK + Hebner to screw Bret
- **Duration:** Days (maybe hours in final form)
- **Pool:** 3-4 people max
- **Schemer discretion:** Maximum
- **Discovery:** Very low
- **Result:** Bret didn't know until it happened. ✅

### Hogan WCW Politicking (1996-2000)

- **Scheme:** Years of burying younger talent
- **Duration:** Months to years
- **Pool:** Huge (Hogan complained to everyone)
- **Schemer discretion:** Low (ego)
- **Discovery:** Near 100%
- **But:** Management co-signing = snitching useless
- **Result:** Everyone knew, nothing happened. ✅

### AEW Brawl Out (2022)

- **Atmosphere shift:** Harmonious → Fractured overnight
- **Effect:** Leaking normalized, intervention collapsed
- **Result:** Post-incident, leaks exploded. ✅

### Ring Boy Scandal (WWF 1992)

- **Type:** Criminal with victims
- **Power differential:** Owner-level protection
- **Corroboration:** Required multiple accusers + legal action
- **Result:** Years to surface, required external pressure. ✅
