## Overview

Management figures (bookers, promoters, owners) have their own philosophical tags that determine how they respond to scandals, treat workers, and run their promotions. These tags shape company culture and scandal response patterns.

**Core Truth:** Promotions feel alive, they evolve, rot, or grow healthy based on who leads them.

## Management Behaviour Tags (11 LOCKED)

| Tag | Description | Scandal Response | Culture Effect |
|-----|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Dirty Loyalty** | Shields scandals, protects friends, prioritizes loyalty and silence over ethics | Strong shielding; delays exposure but worsens eventual fallout | Locker room morale eventually decays; attracts political players |
| **Clean Hands Philosophy** | Prioritizes ethics and public integrity; fires or disciplines scandalous workers quickly | Fast firing/suspension; short-term instability but long-term cultural stability | Attracts principled talent; may lose top stars |
| **Homegrown Purist** | Strongly prefers building stars internally rather than signing outside free agents | N/A to scandals directly | Develops loyal roster; slower to sign proven talent |
| **Corporate Overlord** | Prioritizes corporate sponsorships, PR image, and business deals over locker room culture | Strong PR suppression early; catastrophic brand collapse if scandal breaks | Clean public image; workers feel like assets not people |
| **Outlaw Spirit** | Embraces chaos, edginess, controversy as branding, tolerates more scandal internally | High scandal tolerance; shields "authentic" misbehavior | Attracts rebels; repels family-friendly sponsors |
| **Whistleblower Friendly** | Encourages internal reporting of abuse and scandal; protects whistleblowers | Lowers chain risk; workers trust internal handling | Healthier culture; fewer surprise exposures |
| **Dirty Cover-Up Artist** | Actively covers up scandals via legal tricks, hush money, PR manipulation, buried evidence | Increases short-term shielding; DOUBLES long-term chain risk if exposed | Rot builds invisibly; catastrophic collapses |
| **Booker's Playground** | Treats booking like personal fantasy fulfillment; indulges vanity projects over rational business | May protect favorites regardless of scandal | Worker resentment; political toxicity |
| **Worker First Culture** | Prioritizes wrestlers' physical health, mental wellbeing, creative fulfillment even at financial cost | Fast support systems; genuine care shown | Attracts loyal workers; may struggle retaining stars chasing fame |
| **Union Buster** | Actively undermines union attempts through intimidation, manipulation, terminations | Uses scandal response resources against organizers | Workers fear retaliation; talent exodus risk |
| **Union Ambivalence** | Reluctantly tolerates union formation if forced; doesn't fight hard but doesn't support | Passive resistance; negotiations happen | Partial worker wins; company maintains most control |

## Scandal Response Tags (9 LOCKED - Vol 2 Chunk 07)

These tags specifically govern HOW management reacts when scandals hit:

| Tag | Description | Shield Effect | Long-Term Consequence |
|-----|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Deny At All Costs** | Never admits wrongdoing; doubles down, gaslights, blames others regardless of evidence | Fastest shield collapse over multiple scandals | Brutal rot; eventual catastrophic exposure |
| **Strategic Scapegoater** | Sacrifices mid-level figures to protect leadership image | Stabilizes shield short-term | Fractures long-term loyalty; locker room distrust |
| **Image Before Ethics** | Fakes reforms purely for media and sponsor optics | Delays backlash | Risks harsher collapse later when exposed |
| **Crisis Reformer** | Genuinely cleans house during scandal fallout | Short-term damage | Long-term shield restoration; loyalty rebuild |
| **Corruption Sympathizer** | Subtly supports or tolerates abusive behavior internally | Shield rots invisibly | Eventually explodes even if fans don't notice early |
| **Firefighting Opportunist** | Uses scandal chaos to restructure power (fires enemies, promotes loyalists) | Shield can recover if power plays succeed | High risk, high reward; unpredictable |
| **Bunker Mentality Leader** | Shuts down leaks aggressively; forces locker room silence under siege conditions | Temporarily stabilizes shield | Morale collapses internally; eventual mutiny |
| **Self-Preserver** | Betrays allies, scapegoats friends, destroys relationships purely to save personal power | Shield fluctuates wildly | Success or spectacular crash based on luck/media |
| **Outlaw Romanticizer** | Embraces scandals as brand ("we're the real rebels"); cultivates hardcore loyalty | Forges cult loyalty | Guarantees sponsor/TV death if mainstream needed |

## How Management Tags Affect Gameplay

### Scandal Response

| Management Has... | Then... |
|-------------------|---------|
| Dirty Loyalty | Shields top stars longer; locker room morale eventually decays |
| Clean Hands Philosophy | Fires/suspends fast; short-term instability, long-term cultural stability |
| Corporate Overlord | Strong PR suppression early; catastrophic brand collapse if scandal breaks |
| Worker First Culture | Attracts loyal workers; may struggle retaining stars chasing bigger fame/money |
| Dirty Cover-Up Artist | Short-term success; long-term Chain Risk doubled |
| Whistleblower Friendly | Decreased Chain Risk; workers don't leak externally |

### Hiring/Firing Decisions

| Tag | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| Dirty Loyalty | Will hire scandal-ridden stars if they draw money |
| Clean Hands Philosophy | Won't touch workers with serious baggage |
| Talent Hoarder (potential tag) | Signs too many workers (even scandalous) to deny competitors |
| Homegrown Purist | Prefers creating stars over signing free agents |

### Worker Retention

| Tag | Worker Response |
|-----|-----------------|
| Worker First Culture | Workers stay despite lower pay; loyalty bonus |
| Corporate Overlord | Workers leave for better treatment elsewhere |
| Booker's Playground | Political workers thrive; principled workers flee |
| Outlaw Spirit | Attracts rebels; repels mainstream-oriented workers |

## Tag Combinations

Management figures can have multiple tags creating complex behavior:

| Combination | Example | Result |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Dirty Loyalty + Corporate Overlord | Late-era Vince McMahon | Maximum shielding, maximum eventual collapse |
| Clean Hands + Homegrown Purist | Giant Baba | Slow, ethical development of internal talent |
| Outlaw Spirit + Worker First | Paul Heyman (early ECW) | Chaos with genuine care; beloved but unstable |
| Union Buster + Dirty Cover-Up Artist | Worst-case scenario | Workers crushed; scandals buried; inevitable implosion |

---

## Historical Examples

| Figure | Tags | Outcome |
|--------|------|---------|
| **Giant Baba** | Clean Hands, Homegrown Purist, Worker First | AJPW's legendary stability and loyalty |
| **Vince McMahon** | Dirty Loyalty, Corporate Overlord, Dirty Cover-Up Artist | Decades of buried scandals, 2022-2024 exposure cascade |
| **Paul Heyman (ECW)** | Outlaw Spirit, Worker First, Booker's Playground | Revolutionary product, financial chaos |
| **Eric Bischoff (WCW)** | Corporate Overlord, Talent Hoarder | Initial success, roster bloat, morale collapse |
| **Gedo (NJPW)** | Homegrown Purist, Clean Hands | Stable development system, few scandals |
