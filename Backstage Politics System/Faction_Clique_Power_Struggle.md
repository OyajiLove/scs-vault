# Faction/Clique Power Struggle Mechanics

📛 **NAME:** Faction/Clique Power Struggle Mechanics  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Backstage Politics / Political Warfare  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** faction, clique, power struggle, coup, backstage, politics, booking war, sabotage  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how backstage cliques escalate from cold wars to full political warfare, including booking coups, mass walkouts, and the potential destruction of entire eras. When locker room fractures meet fan subculture wars, promotions can burn.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Power struggles erupt when cliques gain critical mass and booking favors one side
- 7 escalation stages from Whisper Campaigns to Full Coup Attempt
- Clique strength calculated from star power, locker room loyalty, booking leverage, media sympathy
- Workers must choose sides: picking wrong side = burial, exile, political suicide
- Faction wars can create Immortal Icons or crush workers into Lost Legends

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (deterministic power calculations; LLM could generate political drama narratives, shoot promo content)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 250-256 (locked)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Locker_Room_Political_Mutation]] - Clique formation that leads to power struggles
- [[Fan_Subculture_Infighting]] - Fan wars that fuel backstage factions
- [[Golden_Era_Worker_Forging]] - Faction war survivors can become Immortal Icons
- [[Scandal System]] - Scandals can trigger or result from power struggles
- [[Contract System]] - Contract leverage in power struggles

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact clique strength calculation formula
- Coup success probability thresholds
- How booking AI responds to power struggle pressure
- Exiled Faction Formation mechanics (half-baked)

## 1. WHEN POWER STRUGGLES ERUPT

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fanbase Fracturing Peaks** | Fan subcultures grow so divided that workers must politically choose sides |
| **Locker Room Clique Growth** | Cliques gain critical mass: multiple main eventers, midcard loyalists, agents, and sympathetic bookers |
| **Booking Decisions Favor One Clique** | Factions feel emboldened, rivals feel threatened. Political arms race begins. |
| **Backstage Betrayals and Grievances** | Longstanding trust erodes: workers sabotage angles, bury rising stars, leak to media |
| **Booking Vacuum or Leadership Weakness** | Booker burned out, owner distracted: opens gates for full political coup |

### Trigger Thresholds

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| **Fan Subculture Variance** | 3+ major subcultures with 20%+ share each |
| **Clique Critical Mass** | 2+ main eventers + 3+ midcarders + 1 agent/booker ally |
| **Booking Favoritism** | 60%+ of title shots/main events to one clique over 6 months |
| **Leadership Weakness** | Booker trust below 40% OR owner distracted flag |

## 2. STAGES OF POWER STRUGGLE (7 STAGES)

| Stage | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **1** | **Whisper Campaigns** | Rumours about rival workers' reliability, injuries, attitude. Seeds of doubt spread to management and locker room. |
| **2** | **Booking Resistance** | Workers begin rejecting finishes, refusing jobs, half-assing matches involving rival cliques |
| **3** | **Favouritism Arms Race** | Cliques pressure booking for pushes, title reigns, faction dominance angles |
| **4** | **Public Signals** | Shoot promos, veiled backstage interviews, coded crowd pandering: factions leak real tension onto screens |
| **5** | **Splinter Booking** | Shows become uneven: protected workers vs politically frozen ones |
| **6** | **Open Warfare** | Direct confrontation, public callouts, contract leverage plays |
| **7** | **Full Coup Attempt** | Mass walkout threat, collective contract refusals, behind-the-scenes political takeover bids |

### Stage Escalation Triggers

| From Stage | To Stage | Trigger |
|------------|----------|---------|
| 1 → 2 | Whisper → Resistance | Management ignores whispers OR takes sides |
| 2 → 3 | Resistance → Arms Race | Clique sees booking resistance succeed |
| 3 → 4 | Arms Race → Public Signals | Frustration boils over OR strategic leak decision |
| 4 → 5 | Public Signals → Splinter | Management fails to address OR sides with one faction |
| 5 → 6 | Splinter → Open Warfare | Worker careers actively damaged by political booking |
| 6 → 7 | Open Warfare → Coup | Clique believes they have leverage to force change |

## 3. CLIQUE STRENGTH CALCULATIONS

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Star Power** | 30% | Combined popularity of clique members |
| **Locker Room Loyalty** | 25% | How many workers support or sympathize with clique |
| **Booking Leverage** | 20% | Title holders, main eventers, contract status |
| **Media Sympathy** | 15% | Dirt sheets, social media, fan support |
| **Agent/Booker Allies** | 10% | Internal power structure allies |

### Clique Power Tiers

| Power Level | Score | Capability |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Weak** | 0-25 | Can whisper but easily crushed |
| **Moderate** | 26-50 | Can resist but not control |
| **Strong** | 51-75 | Can influence booking significantly |
| **Dominant** | 76-100 | Can attempt coups, reshape promotion |

---

## 4. SIMULATION MECHANICS

| Mechanic | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Clique Strength Calculations** | Power based on star power (popularity), locker room loyalty, booking leverage, media sympathy |
| **Silent Cold Wars vs Hot Coups** | Some wars stay shadowy (sabotage, whispers). Some explode into mass contract wars, no-shows, scandal blowouts. |
| **Leadership Takeover Attempts** | If clique strong enough + booker weak enough → attempted full booking regime change |
| **Worker Career Risk During Wars** | Midcarders must choose sides. Picking wrong side = burial, exile, political suicide. |
| **Fanbase Perception Shifts** | Fans catch wind of fractures. Choose sides emotionally. Crowd reactions fracture. |

### Warfare Types

| Type | Characteristics | Resolution |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| **Cold War** | Whispers, sabotage, passive resistance | Can simmer for years, slow damage |
| **Hot War** | Public confrontation, shoot promos, walkouts | Forces rapid resolution, high damage |
| **Coup Attempt** | Coordinated takeover bid | Success = regime change, Failure = purge |

## 5. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Event | Factions | Outcome |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **WWF Kliq Power (1995-1996)** | HBK, Nash, Hall protect each other, sabotage rivals (Bam Bam Bigelow, Shane Douglas) | Kliq dominance until mass exodus to WCW |
| **WCW NWO Bloat Era** | Hogan camp vs Outsiders vs Homegrown WCW loyalists | Booking chaos eventually collapses company |
| **NJPW Inokiism Crisis** | Shootstyle loyalists vs traditional pro wrestling purists | Backstage cold war kills fanbase for a generation |
| **AEW Post-Brawl Out Era** | Punk camp vs Elite loyalists vs Emotional Storytelling movement | Ongoing fractures, uncertain resolution |

### AEW Model (2022-2025)

| Faction | Allegiance |
|---------|------------|
| **Elite Camp** | Kenny, Bucks, Hangman (loyalists, emotional story flagbearers) |
| **Punk Camp** | Punk, FTR, realism-driven worker movement |
| **Emotional Story Wave** | Swerve, Hangman emotional fans detaching partially from Elite/Crash TV aesthetic |

Booking fractures. Fan reactions fracture. Locker room cold wars. Future coups always simmering.
