## Core Concept

When loyalty fractures deepen, vendettas form, and emotional booking wounds linger, some workers transition into political actors.

Political warfare means:
- Forming backstage factions
- Subtly sabotaging rivals
- Steering booking decisions through manipulation, threat, charisma, and influence
- Protecting allies emotionally and career-wise
- Waging long emotional wars that may never be officially recognized, but reshape entire promotions

**True political survival game, not mechanical "charisma stat" nonsense.**

## How Worker Political Power is Built ✅ LOCKED

| Power Source | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Popularity and Emotional Loyalty** | Workers beloved by fans (especially emotionally, not just pops) have leverage because screwing them risks fan backlash |
| **Loyalty Web Size and Strength** | Workers with strong backstage loyalty networks (stables, friendships, alliances) can resist booking attacks and reinforce pushes |
| **Charisma and Political Cunning** | High Charisma (visible) + high hidden "Cunning" (emotional manipulation trait based on Ego, Focus, Adaptability fusion) = sway locker room opinions and subtly sabotage others |
| **Booking Position and Historical Memory** | Long-standing legends or emotional anchors are harder to bury politically unless they self-destruct |
| **Road Agent/Booker Allies** | Workers aligned with emotionally powerful agents or co-bookers have hidden booking protection |

**Political power isn't visible on a chart. It's felt in how booking flows, how locker room murmurs, how media subtly frames stories.**

## How Political Wars Play Out ✅ LOCKED

| Stage | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **1. Subtle Undermining** | Political players push for their rivals to be booked into unfair losses, bad match pairings, cold feuds |
| **2. Alliance Building** | Faction loyalty intensifies. Workers orbit powerful figures emotionally and career-wise. |
| **3. Booking Drift** | Over time, rival workers see slower pushes, worse matches, harsher betrayal arcs. Not always obvious unless you're looking for patterns. |
| **4. Public Story Leaks** | Media "rumors" emerge about backstage favoritism, resentment, booking corruption |
| **5. Locker Room Drift or Revolt** | If political wars become open enough, locker room fractures solidify, exoduses happen, or company soul collapses |

Some political wars burn quietly for years. Others explode in open schisms.

## Political Risk Factors ✅ LOCKED

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| **Overreach** | Political players who get too greedy spark visible revolt. Fanbase and locker room can turn, destroying careers. |
| **Underdog Rebellions** | Workers quietly buried can build slow rebellion arcs. Smart bookers or fans rescue them if timing and emotional climate match. |
| **Promotion Identity Drift** | Promotions seen as political cesspools can suffer soul death. Fans emotionally abandon them even if product stays "good" on paper. |

**Survival requires emotional intelligence, not just stat dominance.**

## Real-World Examples

| Example | SCS Behavior |
|---------|--------------|
| **HBK vs Bret Hart (1996-97)** | Subtle burial attempts, lobbying for belt control, poisoning locker room morale, culminating in industry-wide collapse of trust |
| **Hulk Hogan vs WCW Locker Room (1996-2000)** | Booking demands, finish vetoes, golden circle around Hogan, political blackballing of dissenters like Konnan, public company death spiral |
| **Triple H and Kliq Politics (1990s)** | Finish controls, push manipulations, talent vetting by personal loyalty networks |

**Political warfare changes not just careers, but the soul and future of entire promotions.**

## Philosophy

> "In SCS, Worker Political War Systems make locker rooms alive, dangerous, emotional ecosystems. Workers fight for survival through loyalty, charisma, emotional leverage, hidden alliances, betrayal scars, booking manipulation. Not everything is mechanical. Real political survival and collapse exist now. HBK and Hogan mode: activated and immortalized."
