# Clique Coup System

📛 **NAME:** Clique Coup System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Backstage Politics / Power Seizures  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** coup, power seizure, booking takeover, exile, clique, rebellion, regime change  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how backstage cliques can seize booking power, force regime changes, or trigger mass exoduses. Includes post-coup booking culture shifts and exiled clique warfare mechanics.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Cliques can attempt power seizures when conditions align (betrayal, discontent, critical mass)
- Coups progress through stages: Whisper Network → Testing → Visible Rebellion → Power Play → Outcome
- Success/failure depends on clique strength, locker room support, fan perception, company stability
- Successful coups reshape booking philosophy, push patterns, and promotion traits
- Failed coups lead to exile, new promotions, or wartime booking against former company

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes (generate shoot promo content, media leak narratives, political maneuvering dialogue)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 121-140 (locked)

## 1. COUP TRIGGERS

| Trigger Condition | Example |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Massive Betrayal/Scandal Event** | Montreal Screwjob, Brawl Out, company-selling scandals |
| **Locker Room Discontent Peaks** | Booking injustices, abusive management, perceived betrayals |
| **Clique Reaches Critical Size** | Enough top carders, agents, and bookers aligned |
| **Booking Vacuum Appears** | Booker burnout, resignations, death, owner instability |
| **Company Desperation/Collapse** | Financial peril, ratings death spirals, worker uprisings |

---

## 2. COUP STAGES

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Whisper Network Grows** | Workers quietly lobby, politic, build alliances |
| **Testing Phase** | Clique pushes back: resisting finishes, requesting favorable angles |
| **Visible Rebellion** | Open refusals to job, shoot promos, walkouts |
| **Power Play** | Mass walkout threat, political pressure on owners, ultimatums |
| **Outcome** | Coup succeeds (regime change) OR fails (exile/firing) |

---

## 3. SUCCESS/FAILURE FACTORS

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Clique Leadership Quality** | Charisma, loyalty, political intelligence of leaders |
| **Locker Room Balance** | Broader support for clique vs management |
| **Public Fan Perception** | Fans side with clique ("fight the machine!") or trust management |
| **Financial Stability** | Broke companies easier to pressure; stable ones can fire and rebuild |
| **Media Narrative Control** | Press leaks, dirt sheet wars affect momentum |

---

## 4. COUP OUTCOMES

| Result | Effects |
|--------|---------|
| **Full Power Seizure** | Clique leaders become de facto bookers; philosophy shifts, enemies buried |
| **Partial Takeover** | Clique gains concessions (pushes, titles) but no regime change |
| **Failed Coup → Exile** | Leaders fired, blackballed, or jump to rivals/start own promotion |
| **Silent Resistance** | Management survives but locker room bitter, seeds future conflicts |

## 5. POST-COUP BOOKING CULTURE SHIFT

When a clique successfully seizes power:

### Immediate Effects

| Effect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Booking Philosophy Changes** | Match structures, finishes, priorities reshape to clique ideology |
| **Promotion Traits Mutate** | Aggressive opportunists → Heat Merchant; Purists → Traditionalist |
| **Push Pattern Overhaul** | Clique loyalists rocket up; enemies frozen, depushed, or buried |
| **Title Lineage Shifts** | Championships protected inside clique OR hot-potato chaos |
| **New Clique-Aligned Factions** | Kayfabe factions on TV mirror real-world power structure |

### Long-Term Risks

| Over Time | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| **Locker Room Fragmentation** | Outsiders fall in line, quietly resist, or plan counter-coups |
| **Fanbase Realignment/Revolt** | Fans embrace new rulers OR rebel against favoritism |
| **Booking Innovation or Rot** | Golden era (reformation) OR political stagnation |
| **Historical Memory** | "The Clique Era" remembered positively or negatively for decades |

## 6. EXILED CLIQUE STORYLINES

When a clique fails and is exiled:

### Immediate Effects

| Effect | Behavior |
|--------|----------|

| **Wartime Booking** | Exiles appear in rival companies with shoot references |
| **Fanbase Polarization** | Some fans side with exiles ("Real heroes!") |
| **Recruitment Wars** | Rivals recruit midcarders and disillusioned stars |

### Exiled Clique Warfare Tactics

| Tactic | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Shoot Promos and Callouts** | Blurred reality promos attacking old company |
| **Talent Raiding** | Formal/backdoor recruitment drives on old roster |
| **"Fake Version" Factions** | Parody or "true" versions of old faction |
| **Angle Referencing Real Events** | Storylines blur kayfabe and reality |
