## Overview

Workers can focus their training on specific skills or style tags. This deliberate practice accelerates improvement in the targeted area at the cost of broader development. Players (or AI) set training focus for workers in their promotion.

## Focus Types

### Skill Focus

Target a specific stat for accelerated improvement:

| Focus Category | Targetable Skills | Effect |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Bell-to-Bell** | Technical, Striking, Aerial, Power, Submission, Psychology, Pacing, Selling | +1 bonus to growth chance |
| **Physical** | Strength, Speed, Stamina, Durability | +1 bonus, higher injury risk |
| **Entertainment** | Mic Skills, Character Work, Crowd Connection, Entrance | +1 bonus |
| **Mental** | Ring Psychology, Adaptability, Composure | +1 bonus |

### Tag Acquisition Focus

Target earning a specific style tag:

| Tag Type | Training Requirement | Acquisition Time |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Style Tags** (e.g., "Submission Specialist") | High base stat + focused training | 6-12 months |
| **Performance Tags** (e.g., "Ring General") | Experience + training | 1-2 years |
| **Specialty Tags** (e.g., "Hardcore Specialist") | Repeated booking + training | 6 months |

**Tag Acquisition Formula (Conceptual):**
```
Tag Acquisition Chance = (Relevant Stat / 20) × Training Months × Mentor Bonus
```

## Training Time Investment

| Intensity | Time per Week | Effect | Risk |
|-----------|---------------|--------|------|
| **Light** | 5-10 hours | Normal growth | None |
| **Moderate** | 15-20 hours | +1 to focused skill | Minor fatigue |
| **Intensive** | 25-30 hours | +2 to focused skill | Fatigue, injury risk |
| **Extreme** | 35+ hours | +3 to focused skill | High burnout, injury risk |

**Burnout Risk:**
- Intensive training for 3+ months: Morale check
- Extreme training for 2+ months: Injury risk + morale check
- Drive trait affects burnout resistance

## Opportunity Cost

Focused training has tradeoffs:

| Focus Level | Targeted Improvement | Other Skills |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| **No Focus** | Normal growth all skills | Normal growth |
| **Light Focus** | +1 targeted | Normal elsewhere |
| **Heavy Focus** | +2 targeted | -1 elsewhere |
| **Obsessive Focus** | +3 targeted | -2 elsewhere |

Workers who obsessively focus may become specialists at the cost of well-rounded development.
