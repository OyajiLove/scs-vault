## Overview

Workers improve their abilities through training, experience, and focused development. Growth rates vary by age, training philosophy, mentor guidance, and natural potential. The system balances realistic career progression with gameplay engagement.

---

## Growth Rate by Career Phase

### Development Phase (Pre-Debut to Age 24)
- **Base Growth:** +2-4 points per year in trained skills
- **Potential Expansion:** Can increase skill ceiling through rigorous training
- **Tag Acquisition:** Style tags learnable through focused training
- **Modifier:** Training philosophy affects which stats grow fastest

### Rising Phase (Age 25-28)
- **Base Growth:** +1-3 points per year
- **Specialization:** Growth concentrated in core style
- **Match Experience:** In-ring stats benefit from actual matches
- **Modifier:** Good booking accelerates growth, poor booking slows it

### Peak Phase (Age 28-35)
- **Base Growth:** +0-1 points per year
- **Maintenance:** Easier to maintain than improve
- **Psychology Growth:** Mental stats can still improve (experience)
- **Modifier:** Workload affects whether stats maintain or decline

### Decline Phase (Age 35+)
- **Base Growth:** 0 (maintenance only)
- **Decline Rate:** -1 per year in physical stats
- **Psychology Exception:** Mental stats may INCREASE (experience)
- **Modifier:** Injuries accelerate decline, good conditioning slows it

## Stat Growth by Category

| Stat Category | Peak Growth Age | Decline Start | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|-------|
| **Physical** | 23-28 | 33-35 | Speed/Agility decline first |
| **Bell-to-Bell** | 25-32 | 35-40 | Technical peaks later |
| **Entertainment** | 28-40 | 45+ | Charisma ages well |
| **Mental** | 30-45+ | Rare decline | Experience compounds |

### Physical Stats
- **Strength:** Peaks mid-20s, declines slowly
- **Speed/Agility:** Peaks early 20s, declines fastest
- **Stamina:** Peaks late 20s, moderate decline
- **Durability:** Peaks late 20s, injury history affects decline

### Bell-to-Bell Stats
- **Technical:** Peaks late 20s to early 30s
- **Striking:** Peaks mid-20s
- **Aerial:** Peaks early to mid-20s (physical demands)
- **Psychology:** Peaks 30s-40s (experience-based)
- **Selling:** Peaks 30s (understanding builds)

### Entertainment Stats
- **Mic Skills:** Improves throughout career
- **Character Work:** Peaks in 30s (self-awareness)
- **Crowd Connection:** Can grow until retirement
- **Entrance:** Stable, rarely declines

### Mental Stats
- **Ring Psychology:** Improves with experience, rarely declines
- **Composure:** Improves until late career
- **Adaptability:** Peaks mid-career

## Training Focus Effects

Workers can focus training on specific areas:

| Focus Area | Growth Boost | Trade-off |
|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Technical Emphasis** | +50% Technical growth | -25% Entertainment growth |
| **Physical Conditioning** | +50% Physical growth | Time commitment |
| **Entertainment Development** | +50% Entertainment growth | -25% Technical growth |
| **Specialist Focus** | +100% one stat | -25% all others |
| **Balanced Development** | Normal growth | No penalties |

---

## Potential System (Conceptual)

### Potential Ceiling
- Each worker has hidden **potential ceiling** per stat
- Training cannot exceed ceiling without expansion
- Ceiling determined by: natural talent, training philosophy, age at start

### Ceiling Expansion (Rare)
- Exceptional mentor can raise ceiling (+1-2 points)
- Career-defining experience can unlock hidden potential
- Late bloomers exist (ceiling rises after breakthrough)

### Ceiling Contraction
- Major injury can permanently lower ceiling
- Extended absence may reduce ceiling
- Age eventually limits physical ceilings

## RUBBER BAND POTENTIAL MODEL (#170)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #170

### Core Concept

Potential isn't fixed: it stretches/shrinks based on circumstances.

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Repetitions** | Consistent work improves ceilings |
| **Mentorship** | Working with legends boosts potential |
| **Big Match Opportunities** | Succeed = huge boost, fail = stall out |
| **Lifestyle Choices** | Party too much = potential shrinkage |
| **Mentality Stats** | Drive, Adaptability, Toughness affect elasticity |

### Rubber Snap Events

Catastrophic events can permanently damage potential:
- Career-ending or near-career-ending injury
- Major scandal
- Career-derailing push failure
- Burnout from overwork

**Recovery:** Possible but rare and costly.

### Random Traits Affecting Elasticity

| Trait | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Iron Will** | Can exceed original potential range |
| **Gifted Late Bloomer** | Potential expands later in career |
| **Headcase** | Struggles to sustain growth |
| **Injury Prone** | Potential at constant risk |

**Key Quote:** "Not everybody is secretly Bret, but someone you believed in might push through."

## BREAKOUT EVENT MECHANIC (#54)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #54-56, #69

### Core Concept

When a match exceeds crowd expectations by a large margin, a hidden **Career Trajectory Shift** can trigger.

### Effects of Breakout

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stat Bump** | Baseline skills bump by 5-10 points over next 6 months |
| **Fan Perception Rise** | Crowd, locker room, media perception shift |
| **Accelerated Growth** | Skills rise faster for 1-2 years after breakout |
| **Ceiling Expansion** | Hidden potential may increase |

### DDP Example (Locked)

```
DDP: 60 baseline attributes, 80 Potential Cap
Hidden Traits: "High Coachability," "Hard Worker," "Needs Rub"

You book DDP into semi-main with Macho.
Match overdelivers expectations.
Post-Match Report: "Crowd buzz: 'DDP stepped up to a new level tonight.'"
Career Trajectory quietly shifts.
```

**Key Insight:** "Not because he just 'leveled up' RPG-style. Because he fought, struggled, got the rub, and earned a new level."

### Breakout Triggers

| Trigger | Likelihood |
|---------|------------|
| Match rating exceeds expectations by 2+ stars | High |
| Major crowd response to performance | Medium |
| Victory over much higher-ranked opponent | Medium |
| Signature performance in tournament | Medium |
| "Proving themselves" moment in big match loss | Low but meaningful |

---

## RUB MECHANICS (#56)

### Core Rules

- Big opponents can elevate you (if you hold your own emotionally and physically)
- **"Needs Rub"** is a hidden trait some workers have
- Veteran workers can be "willing to give rub" or not (personality-based)
- Getting over through losses is valid

### Tommy Rich Example (Locked Philosophy)

> "Ole Anderson booking Tommy Rich against Abby on Georgia TV... each time Rich would get closer and closer, the fans bought into his story and development as a rookie against a monster... he was getting over THROUGH losses, because he showed guts in defeat."

### Rub Calculation

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Opponent's overness | High |
| Match quality | High |
| Worker's performance (selling, fire) | High |
| Opponent willingness to give rub | Medium |
| Crowd recognition of struggle | Medium |

---

## LOGICAL GROWTH FILTERS (#69)

### Skill Growth Requirements

| Skill | How It Grows |
|-------|-------------|
| **Technical** | Only improves through deliberate workrate matches, technician mentors, long/tough matches |
| **Brawling** | Grows naturally with hardcore matches, stiff work, rougher opponents |
| **Charisma** | Grows through promo reps, character work, crowd connection moments |
| **Athleticism** | Peaks young, declines naturally, rarely improves after mid-20s |
| **Psychology** | Grows through match experience, story-driven feuds, title runs |

### Worker-Specific Growth Examples

| Worker | Growth Pattern |
|--------|---------------|
| Mick Foley | Fighting spirit; technical modest but psychology skyrockets |
| Undertaker | Brawling improves, psychology evolves into "gritty big man" master. Never technical master. |
| Austin | Midcard US worker. With bloody, desperate wars + right opportunity = explosion |

---

## Experience-Based Growth

Beyond formal training, match experience affects growth:

| Experience Type | Stats Affected | Growth Modifier |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Quality Matches** | Psychology, Selling, Pacing | +10-20% |
| **Variety of Opponents** | Adaptability | +15% |
| **High-Stakes Matches** | Composure | +10% |
| **Long Matches** | Stamina, Pacing | +10% |
| **Different Environments** | Crowd Connection | +10% |
| **Poor Matches** | Minimal growth | 0% |
| **Overexposure** | Stagnation risk | -10% |

---

## Growth Acceleration & Inhibition

### Accelerators
- Active mentor (+20-30% growth)
- Training at elite facility (+10-15%)
- Consistent match quality (+10%)
- Focused training regimen (+variable)
- High Drive (Hidden Personality) (+15%)

### Inhibitors
