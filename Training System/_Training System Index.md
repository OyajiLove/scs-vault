# Training & Development System

📛 **SYSTEM ID:** TRAIN-001
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker Development / Career Progression
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** training, development, dojo, mentor, protege, skill growth, tag acquisition, young lion, excursion, green
📝 **SUMMARY:** 

The Training & Development System governs how workers improve skills, acquire new style tags, and progress from rookies to veterans. It encompasses formal dojo systems, mentor relationships, training facility quality, and the interplay between natural talent ceilings and deliberate practice. Young workers start "green" and develop through matches, training, and mentorship.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Workers improve skills through match experience, focused training, and mentorship
- Training facility quality affects development speed and ceiling potential
- Mentors can teach style tags and accelerate specific skill growth
- Natural talent sets initial ceilings; training can raise caps over time
- Dojo systems (Japan) provide intense foundational training
- Excursion systems send trainees abroad to develop before main roster debut
- "Green" tag indicates inexperience; removed through match count and time

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (numeric formulas), but LLM can generate training reports, mentor commentary, and development narratives

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 4 (dojo concepts), Worker Skills (growth rates), Tags System (tag acquisition through training)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** 
- [[Worker_Skills|Worker Skills]] - Stats being developed
- [[Tags_System|Tags System]] - Tag acquisition through training
- [[Aging System/_Aging System Index|Aging & Career Arcs]] - Peak years, decline
- [[Injury System/_Injury System Index|Injury System]] - Injury impact on development
- [[Contract System/_Contract System Index|Contract System]] - Developmental contracts
- [[Faction System/_Faction System Index|Faction System]] - Stable mentorship

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Training effectiveness formulas (how much does focused training improve stats?)
- Mentor influence calculation (how much does mentor quality matter?)
- Skill cap increase mechanics (can training raise natural ceilings?)
- Time investment requirements (hours/weeks per stat point?)
- Training facility quality tiers and effects
- Excursion duration and benefits
- When does "Green" tag get removed?

✅ **STATUS:** Partially Locked (growth rates from Vol 4), Conceptual (dojo/mentor mechanics)

## Design Philosophy

Training transforms raw potential into realized ability. The system distinguishes between:

**Natural Talent:** Initial stat ceilings set at worker generation
**Developed Skill:** Earned improvement through work and experience
**Mentored Growth:** Accelerated learning from veteran guidance

A worker with low natural talent (ceiling 14) can reach that ceiling faster with good training than a high-ceiling worker (ceiling 18) who coasts. Training rewards engagement.

## Integration Points

**With Worker Skills:**
- Training targets specific skills for improvement
- Growth rates vary by skill category and age
- Match experience contributes to organic growth

**With Tags System:**
- Style tags can be acquired through training focus
- Mentor tags may transfer to proteges
- "Green" tag removed after development milestones

**With Aging System:**
- Young workers (18-24) have highest growth potential
- Peak years (28-35) see slowed growth
- Veteran years: mental stats may still improve, physical decline begins

**With Injury System:**
- Injuries interrupt training progress
- Long-term injuries may permanently reduce potential
- Return from injury requires retraining period

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Basic stat growth formulas, match experience contribution
**Phase 2:** Mentor relationships, training focus selection
**Phase 3:** Dojo systems, excursions, facility quality
