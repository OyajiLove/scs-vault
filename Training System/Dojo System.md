## Overview

The Dojo System represents the rigorous Japanese approach to training wrestlers. Unlike Western systems where workers often enter with prior experience, Japanese dojos take young athletes and forge them from scratch through years of demanding physical and mental conditioning. This produces technically sound, disciplined workers with strong fundamentals, but at high human cost.

## Lifestyle Tracker / Aging Modifier (#45)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #45

Lifestyle choices affect how workers age visually and mechanically:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Drinkers/Smokers** | Deeper lines, sunken eyes, rougher aging curves |
| **"Hard liver" personalities** | Faster decline, reduced longevity |
| **Natural freaks** | Slower aging (genetic advantage) |
| **Wrestling Style** | Brawlers/deathmatch workers show more visible wear |

### Genetics/Natural Resistance

Some workers have genetic advantages or disadvantages:

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Scar-prone** | Visible scarring accumulates (Funk bled buckets) |
| **Scar-resistant** | Barely marks despite damage (Baba) |
| **Quick Healer** | Faster recovery times |
| **Fragile Constitution** | More susceptible to long-term damage |

### Visual Portrait Evolution

These factors affect how worker portraits change over time:
- Hard living = more weathered appearance
- Clean living = maintains youthful look longer
- Style damage = visible scars, wear patterns
- Lifestyle tags dynamically affect aging curves
