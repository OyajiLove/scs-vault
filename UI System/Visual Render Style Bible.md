## Overview

> "We're not building characters. We're building how people remember them."

Comic-style renders as the official visual identity of the base world. They support gimmick-first design, capture archetypes and exaggeration vital to drama-driven sim, and embrace worker memory, drift, and rebirth as visual myth.

---

## Format & File Details

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| Format | PNG with transparent background |
| Framing | Waist-up by default (mid-torso to head) |
| Backup Option | Shoulders-up for masked workers, promos, or legacy portraits |
| Resolution | Minimum 512x512, scalable for UI (cards, profiles, banners) |
| Lighting | Studio neutral or stylized soft shadows, mild contrast |
| Export Cropping | Centered with 5-10% padding for overlays |

---

## Tone & Emotion

Style should read like a comic cover, not a panel:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Expression | Strong, readable emotion: defiance, pride, menace, serenity, anguish |
| Pose | Slight posture variation, shoulders relaxed or coiled |
| Eyes | Critical. Gimmick memory lives in the stare. Highlight intensity or emptiness. |
| Emotion Layer | Design like telling audience: "Remember this face." |

---

## Visual Cohesion Guidelines

| Design Pillar | Guideline |
|---------------|-----------|
| Colour Grading | 1-2 dominant tones per render; avoid rainbow unless gimmick demands |
| Linework | Bold, clean comic-style shading. Graphic novel cover, not painterly. |
| Detail Level | High enough for scars, makeup, stitching; low enough to not clash with UI |
| No Background Art | All characters isolated (transparent PNGs); effects added dynamically in-game |

---

## Tag-Driven Stylization

Apply minor variants based on in-universe tags:

| Tag | Render Quirk |
|-----|--------------|
| Immortal / Legacy | Desaturated edges, faded vignette |
| Masked / Supernatural | Sharper contrast, unnatural glow in lighting |
| Modern Pop Gimmick | Bright tones, slight lens flare on shades or jewels |
| Grit-Based Fighter | Harsh shadows, neutral tones, chipped gear |

---

## Visual Memory Principles

Every render should imply:
- **History** (what this character's been through)
- **Emotion** (what they carry)
- **Aura** (what they mean to the crowd)

Even if the player's never seen them wrestle.

---

## Modular World-Build Visual Plan

| Visual Layer | Used For |
|--------------|----------|
| Comic-Style (Primary) | Main world. Emotion, exaggeration, legacy, distinction. |
| Partially Photorealistic (Alt Pack) | Realism-heavy mods, serious fed simmers, territory-era retellings |
| Flat TEW-style (Legacy Pack) | Nostalgia players, text-driven minimalist mods |
| Thunderverse-style (Chaos Pack) | AI-generated alt-worlds, chaos feds, parody universes |

Each render style tells what kind of memory the crowd will carry.

---

## Visual Evolution System

Renders evolve into variant states linked to in-game memory, booking, and persona changes.

### Variant Types

| Variant Type | Trigger Source | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| Heel Turn | Alignment shift | Eyes sharper, smirk or sneer, darker gear tone |
| Face Redemption | Buzz → Drift turn → Memory Snapshot | Softer expression, war-torn gear, glint of vulnerability |
| Gimmick Evolution | Manual repackage or AI arc | Visual overhaul (new attire, mask, hair, posture) |
| Legacy Phase | Worker 15+ years in or 90+ Legacy | Desaturated palette, scars, heavier brows, faded symbol work |
| Injury Return | Worker returns from time off with Buzz >12 | Bandaged version, eye-patch, one arm taped, facial tension |
| Mask Damage/Removal | Lucha/gothic/supernatural arc | Cracked, torn, burned, or fully removed (Face Reveal moment) |
| Myth State | Immortal/Memory Overload | Haloed eyes, cosmic detail, faded inking (fans remember them this way) |

### Artistic Phase Cues

| Phase | Visual Signals |
|-------|----------------|
| Young Lion | Clean, focused eyes, untested confidence, primary gear colours |
| Rising Star | Smirk confidence, bigger accessories, title glimpses |
| Broken Heel | Eye bags, asymmetry, pale or smudged gear tones |
| Redemption Arc | Slight cuts, bruised eyes, weight of history in gaze |
| Icon at Peak | Max saturation, polished presentation, controlled menace |
| End of Line | Muted colour, faint scars, gaze past camera (thinking about legacy) |
| Immortalized | Symbolic distortion (fans no longer see the person, just the icon) |

### System Integration

| System | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| Fan Memory Engine | Snapshots tie to specific render versions |
| Legacy Tracker | High-legacy variants show up in HOF, tributes |
| Promo Recaps | Commentary references past looks ("That mask… it was whole, once.") |
| Ceremony Tools | Auto-selects Myth or Legacy render for final tribute |
| Push Resistance | Worker may resent rebrand if Ego + Traditionalism high |

> "A render is no longer just a static portrait. It's a living relic."

## Render + Style Overlay System

Solution to avoid shipping 20,000 images: base renders + dynamic overlays.

### Base Renders (What Ships)

| Worker Tier | Variants Provided |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Main Roster (Base World) | 1 main + optional 1 alt (legacy, heel, etc.) |
| Midcarders/Supporting | 1 render |
| Legends/Immortals | Up to 2 variants if story-critical |
| Procedural Workers | 1 autogenerated, processed through style layer |

**Est. Total Art Assets: ~3,000–5,000 images**

### Style Overlays (Sim-Generated)

UI-layered effects applied in menus, match summaries, and fan memory flashbacks:

| Overlay Type | Triggered By |
|--------------|--------------|
| Cracked Mask | Lucha betrayal, turn, unmask tease |
| Blood Smear / Scar | Hardcore match trail, injury memory |
| Legacy Desaturation | Fan Memory + Legacy > 85 |
| Myth Glow | Immortal status + post-retirement |
| Greyscale + Sepia | Commentary flashback, in-universe tributes |
| Shattered Glass Edge | Gimmick death, mental breakdown, booking trail "collapse" |
| Firelight Hue | "Final match" booking or mythic comeback |
| Lens Burn + Crowd Light | Overwhelming pop, comeback at Mania/Dome-like event |

All applied dynamically. Zero individual image files needed.

## Visual Anchor Layers v2.0

Modular identity system tied to character identity and shape language, not just pose/position.

### Layer Categories

| Layer | Function | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Craniofacial Structure | Skull shape, jawline, brow, nose | Defines the "face silhouette" (base anchor) |
| Eye Set & Expression | Distance between eyes, eye shape, eyebrow arch | Key to continuity, mood and emotional tone |
| Mouth & Chin Region | Lip fullness, expression lines, dimples, chin cleft | High emotional granularity |
| Hair Base | Hairline, density, growth direction | Differentiates characters at a glance |
| Skin Tone + Texture Map | Base complexion, pore/freckle distribution, weathering | Ensures overlays blend naturally |
| Body Frame Anchor | Shoulder width, trapezius slope, neck length | Preserves physical silhouette |
| Tag-Based Detail Anchors | E.g., "Damaged Jawline," "Iconic Eyebrows," "Burn Scar Left Side" | For workers with iconic physical quirks |

### Expected Similarity by Variant Type

| Variant Type | Expected Similarity | Notes |
|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| Expression Shift (smile → glare) | 95–100% | All structure preserved, pure emotional modulation |
| Gimmick Variant (darker attire, bloodied) | 90–98% | Shape language intact, surface tone changes only |
| Injury Return / Bandaged | 85–95% | Minor obscuring, silhouette and eye/mouth still match |
| Legacy/Aged Version | 80–92% | Wrinkles, posture evolve, identity preserved if anchors respected |
| Hard Gimmick Evolution (face paint, partial mask) | 75–90% | Eyes, cheekbones still match, flair increases variance intentionally |
| Fan Memory Render (mythic glow, faded) | 70–85% | Stylized beyond realism, accuracy traded for emotional impression |

> "Even if the render isn't pixel-perfect, it'll feel like the same person because the eyes still carry their vibe, the silhouette still reads, and the emotional read is continuous."

## Render Generation Pipeline (Recommended)

### Option 3: Custom-Trained Local Diffusion Model

Best long-term solution for visual continuity:

| Strength | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Style consistency | Matches comic-style base world, no outliers |
| Face embedding | Identity preserved across decades of gimmicks |
| Modding support | Players generate alt gimmicks with zero friction |
| Offline rendering | No API dependencies, no server costs |
| Upgradeable | Retrain over time to match new art direction |

### Cost Estimates

| Cost Type | Estimate |
|-----------|----------|
| Training time | 1–2 weeks (with GPU) |
| Storage size | 1.5–3GB total |
| Dev integration | Low-medium (ComfyUI + wrapper) |
| Player hardware | RTX 3060+ recommended |

### Scalable Plan

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Launch | Ship comic-style base renders (1–2 per worker) |
| Optional Download | "SCS Render Lab" local generator |
| Modding Guide | Drop-in face references, gimmick prompts, presets |
| Mid-Life Update | New training rounds (80s era pack, Joshi pack, etc.) |

---

## Render Evolution Engine

Automatic render generation based on in-game events. No user prompting required.

### Trigger System

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Gimmick repackage → Booked | Check for render variant. If not present, flag sent to Render Engine |
| Worker reaches age milestone | "Generate Legacy Variant" command sent |
| Worker turns heel → pops Buzz 15+ | "Generate Heel Variant" command sent |
| Booking Trail = "Collapse Arc" | "Generate Broken Variant" with darker tone and visible wear |

### Tag-Based Gimmick Logic

| Gimmick Tag | Render Modifier |
|-------------|----------------|
| "Darker Edge" | Mood = angrier, palette = muted, eye contact = direct |
| "Mask Upgrade" | Add mask variant, retain eye shape & silhouette |
| "Legacy 2035" | Age 15-20%, lighting = softer, scars = optional |
| "Ceremony Final" | Desaturated, vignette, myth effect active |

### What You Get

- Visual legacy built into simulation
- Zero user prompting required
- Crowd reacts to appearance organically (new mask = mythic chants, aged look = "You Still Got It")
- Hall of Fame profiles reflect how they changed, not just what they won
