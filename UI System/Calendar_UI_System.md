## CALENDAR VISUAL EVOLUTION BY ERA

| Era | Calendar Style | Description |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 1970s–1989 | 🟫 Paper Desk Calendar | Big, yellowed pages. Handwritten match notes. Dog-eared corners, coffee rings. Post-its, scraps tucked into edges. Maybe a stray Sharpie doodle. |
| 1990–2006 | 🖥 Clunky Windows Calendar UI | CRT monitor or early flat-screen. Outlook-style "Week View" interface. Emails layered to side. Fax summary pane. Slower scrolling, slightly laggy mouse feel. Emo stylings for indie feds: purple background, bad fonts. |
| 2007–Present | 📱 Sleek Calendar App or Monitor Overlay | Modern touchscreen planner. Google Calendar-esque grid. Tap to open show cards. Sidebar widgets: storylines, obligations, titles. Alerts for crowd energy forecasts. |

## COMMUNICATION STYLES BY ERA

| Era | Primary Communication Style |
|-----|----------------------------|
| 1970s–1989 | Sticky notes, corkboards, landline voicemails. Yellowed paper slips. Coffee stains. "Dusty called – said not to book that cage again." Inter-agent memos passed in person. Torn paper tucked under a beer bottle. |
| 1990–2006 | Email UI, Faxes, Flip Phones. CRT monitor inbox: "1 New Message – Subject: Weekly Card Talk." Agent emails with attachments. Fax tones occasionally play. SMS-style popup on flip phone. |
| 2007–Present | Smartphone + App Messages. Messenger UI, push-style text blurbs. Voice memos. Notification dots on "Creative Chat" app. Group thread from agents. |
