## Overview

Managers don't just stand at ringside: they actively affect match outcomes, crowd reactions, and booking patterns. A skilled manager can turn the tide of a match through distraction, interference, or simply by generating heat that elevates the moment. The system tracks how manager presence modifies match outcomes, when interference becomes predictable, and the risks of overusing dirty finishes.

## Ringside Presence Effects

### Passive Benefits (Always Active)

| Effect | Modifier | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Momentum Bonus** | +5% to +15% | Client gets energy boost from manager support |
| **Heat Generation** | +10% to +25% | Manager draws crowd reactions that elevate match |
| **Promo Coverage** | Variable | Pre/post match promos cover for weak talkers |
| **Psychological Edge** | +5% | Opponent distracted by manager presence |
| **Commentary Hooks** | Flavor | Announcers have more to discuss |

### Modifier Factors

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Manager Charisma** | Higher charisma = stronger passive effects |
| **Manager Heat Level** | Heel managers with nuclear heat amplify matches |
| **Client Relationship** | Strong bond = larger bonuses |
| **Crowd Recognition** | Famous managers add star power |

## Active Interference Types

### Distraction Spots

| Type | Description | Success Rate | Risk |
|------|-------------|--------------|------|
| **Verbal Distraction** | Manager argues with ref or opponent | 70-85% | Low (rarely caught) |
| **Physical Distraction** | Climbs apron, waves towel, bangs mat | 60-75% | Medium (may get ejected) |
| **Foreign Object Toss** | Throws object into ring to distract ref | 50-65% | High (DQ risk) |
| **Opponent Interaction** | Grabs ankle, trips worker at ropes | 45-60% | High (DQ risk) |

### Direct Interference

| Type | Description | Success Rate | Risk |
|------|-------------|--------------|------|
| **Cheap Shot** | Strike when ref is down or distracted | 55-70% | Very High |
| **Foreign Object Attack** | Weapon strike (chair, brass knucks, fish) | 50-65% | Very High |
| **Ref Distraction + Attack** | Manager distracts ref while client cheats | 60-75% | Medium |
| **Run-In Assistance** | Manager physically enters ring to help | 40-55% | Maximum (ejection, DQ) |

### Post-Match Actions

| Type | Description | Heat Effect |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Celebration** | Manager celebrates with client | Moderate |
| **Humiliation Ritual** | Post-match degradation of opponent (Big Lard's hot dog) | Very High |
| **Beat Down Assistance** | Joins post-match assault | High |
| **Protective Retreat** | Helps client escape before revenge | Moderate |

## Finish Type Modification

Manager interference changes how finishes are classified:

| Base Finish | With Interference | Crowd Perception |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Clean Pin** | Distraction-assisted pin | Dirty win, heat on manager |
| **Clean Submission** | Foreign object weakened opponent | Tainted win |
| **Dominant Victory** | Manager softened opponent pre-match | Less impressive |
| **Close Contest** | Manager tips balance | Classic heel finish |
| **Upset Victory** | Manager's interference decisive | Cheap upset, maximum heat |

### Finish Impact on Systems

| System | Effect of Dirty Finish |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Crowd Memory** | Dirty finishes remembered as "manager stole it" |
| **Predictability** | Pattern forms if manager always interferes |
| **Feud Heat** | Interference extends feuds naturally |
| **Worker Credibility** | Winner may lose respect if always needs help |

---

## Predictability Patterns

Crowds learn manager interference patterns:

| Pattern | Recognition Threshold | Crowd Effect |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Manager always distracts for finish** | 3-4 occurrences | Crowd anticipates, tension drops |
| **Foreign object every match** | 2-3 occurrences | Fans expect weapon, surprise dead |
| **Ref bump + interference** | 3-5 occurrences | Predictable, eye-rolling begins |
| **Post-match beatdown ritual** | 4-6 occurrences | Becomes expected, heat diminishes |

### Pattern Breaking

| Strategy | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Clean finish after interference pattern** | Surprise pop, crowd respects match |
| **Manager ejected pre-match** | Raises stakes, client must win alone |
| **Manager costs client the match** | Subverts expectations, potential turn |
| **Manager fails interference** | Babyface overcomes, bigger pop |

---

## DQ Risk Assessment

| Interference Level | DQ Chance | Factors |
|-------------------|-----------|---------|
| **Verbal Only** | 0-5% | Rarely causes DQ |
| **Apron Distraction** | 5-15% | Ejection more likely than DQ |
| **Physical Contact (Opponent)** | 20-40% | Depends on ref position |
| **Foreign Object (Visible)** | 40-60% | High risk if ref sees |
| **Direct Attack** | 60-80% | Almost always caught |
| **Run-In** | 80-95% | Nearly automatic DQ |

### Ref Factors

| Ref Type | Modifier |
|----------|----------|
| **Blind Ref** | -20% DQ chance |
| **Strict Ref** | +20% DQ chance |
| **Heel-Friendly Ref** | -30% DQ chance (storyline) |
| **Corrupt Ref** | 0% DQ chance (storyline) |

## Manager Skill Effects

Manager skill levels modify interference success:

| Skill | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Interference Skill (High)** | Better timing, higher success rate |
| **Interference Skill (Low)** | Botches, gets caught, costs matches |
| **Heat Generation (High)** | Crowd engaged even when spotted |
| **Heat Generation (Low)** | Interference falls flat |
| **Promo Skill** | Covers for failed interference with promos |

---

## Historical Examples

| Manager | Interference Style | Signature Spot |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Bobby Heenan** | Subtle distraction, strategic objects | Weasel suit comedy, taking bumps |
| **Jim Cornette** | Tennis racket shots, constant interference | Racket to the head |
| **Big Lard** | Hot dog distraction, post-match ritual | "The Distraction Dog" foreign object |
| **Jimmy Hart** | Megaphone shots, verbal distraction | Megaphone interference |
| **Paul Bearer** | Urn-based mind games, supernatural | Urn distraction, Undertaker control |
| **Sensational Sherri** | Physical attacks, scratching, low blows | Anything goes heel valet |

## Booking Considerations

### When to Use Interference

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Heel needs protected loss** | Babyface wins despite interference |
| **Extending feud** | Interference prevents clean resolution |
| **Building manager heat** | Manager costs heel the match accidentally |
| **Protecting worker** | Manager takes blame for loss |
| **Setting up blow-off** | Interference pattern justifies cage match |

### When to Avoid Interference

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Establishing new champion** | Clean win builds credibility |
| **Blow-off match** | Decisive finish needed |
| **Pattern too predictable** | Surprise with clean finish |
| **Worker needs solo credibility** | Manager ejected or absent |
