---

## Fan Reaction

Intense sympathy, emotional investment, bittersweet attachment. They're fighting fate itself.

---

## Design Philosophy

> "I will fight anyway. Because even if I lose, my struggle itself is proof that I lived."

The Defiant Soul differs from the Stoic Ace in that:
- **Stoic Ace:** Expected to win, carries company, mythological
- **Defiant Soul:** Fighting against the odds, may never reach the top, tragedy is part of appeal

---

## Booking Considerations

- Losses can INCREASE popularity (when handled right)
- Title chases more powerful than title reigns
- Must eventually get payoff or crowd loses faith
- Great in tournaments (can lose but be MVP)
- Tag with Stoic Ace creates legendary feuds

## Misawa/Kawada Dynamic (Locked Reference)

The Four Pillars dynamic illustrates the distinction:
- **Misawa:** Stoic Ace (Warrior Saint subtype)
- **Kawada:** Defiant Soul (Iron Rebel subtype)
- Their rivalry worked because of this archetype contrast
