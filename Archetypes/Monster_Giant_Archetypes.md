#### Vol 1 Foundation

#### Vol 2 Additions

| Subtype | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Savage Monster** | Plays into territorial-era racialized monster imagery: "wild man," "untamed beast" gimmicks. Seen as thrilling and frightening, but aged poorly into the modern era. *Modern audiences may criticize these gimmicks for being racially insensitive while others still cheer based on region/demographic.* | Kamala, Abdullah the Butcher, Giant Kimala #2 |
| **Foreign Monster Heel** | Large, dominant foreigners positioned as "threats" to American/world champions, emphasizing fear of "the other." Often presented as unstoppable villains. | Yokozuna, Giant Gonzalez, early Great Khali, Sika (early Wild Samoan) |

### Monster Lifecycle Variations (LOCKED)

| Variation | Profile | Mechanical Effects |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Young Hungry Monster** | High strength, lower psych, mid-high drive | Learns quickly, takes risks, can be steered |
| **Veteran Monster** | Strength/menace high, agility down, drive dipping | Reliable but may resist new directions |
| **Broken Monster** | Agility/stamina plummet, sells smarter | Shorter matches, protected finishes needed |
| **Coasting Monster** | High initial push, low drive, fades | Phoning it in, fans sense laziness |
| **Monster Survivor** | High durability/psych, adapts to survive | Style adapts to limitations |

### Monster Tags

## Giant Archetype (#19, #226)

**Core Skills (MANDATORY):**

| Skill | Minimum |
|-------|---------|
| **Menace** | 15+ |
| **Believability** | 14+ |
| **Height** | 6'6"+ |

### Giant Subtypes

| Subtype | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Athletic Giant** | Moves well for size, surprise dives | Early Big Show (Paul Wight), Bigelow |
| **Ogre Giant** | Slow-moving, death-by-suffocation style | Old André, Giant Gonzales |
| **Charismatic Giant** | Big aura, big energy, transcends pure size | Vader, early Big Show |
| **Monster Giant** | Booked as human natural disasters | Peak André, Brody King |
| **Gentle Giant** | Fan-favorite bruiser with heart | Big Show early run, Haystacks |
| **Silent Enforcer Giant** | Muscle for a faction | Diesel early WWF |
| **Technical Giant (VERY RARE)** | Big men who could legit wrestle | Early Giant Baba |

### Key Corrections

- Umaga (6'4") is NOT a Giant, fits Wildman Brawler better
- Yokozuna = honorary giant (bulk over height)
- Luke Gallows was never a technician
- Technical Giant is extremely rare; most giants rely on presence over skill

### Early Giant Baba Note

Best example of Technical Giant. Would go hold-for-hold 60 minutes with The Destroyer. Great mat wrestler in 60s/early 70s.

## Hardcore Archetype (#17, #223)

**Core Skills (MANDATORY):**

| Skill | Minimum |
|-------|---------|
| **Brawling** | 12+ |
| **Believability** | 12+ |

**CRITICAL DESIGN DECISION:** NO separate "Hardcore" skill rating. Hardcore performance is emergent from brawling, believability, durability, psychology, menace, tags, and health engine.

### Why No Hardcore Stat?

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Redundancy | Real hardcore = storytelling + absorbing punishment |
| Game Balance | Avoid skill-bloat |
| Flexibility | New Jack vs Onita feel totally different |
| Era-Dependent | 1980s hardcore barely existed, 2000s is its own scene |

### Hardcore Subtypes

| Subtype | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Hardcore Icon** | Legendary name draws based on reputation alone | Foley, Onita, Terry Funk |
| **Hardcore Daredevil** | Flying madmen, bump crazy | Sabu, Darby Allin |
| **Garbage Brawler** | Wild weapon brawlers, chaos over finesse | New Jack, Abdullah |
| **Technical Hardcore Hybrid** | Legit skilled wrestlers who choose violence | Cactus Jack '95-97, Masato Tanaka |
| **Violent Psychopath** | Sheer menace and willingness to hurt | Necro Butcher |

### Hardcore Full Attribute Ranges

| Attribute | Range |
|-----------|-------|
| Brawling | 12-20 |
| Believability | 12-20 |
| Durability | 8-20 |
| Stamina | 6-16 |
| Technical Skill | 2-12 |
| Agility | 4-14 |
| Power | 6-16 |
| Psychology | 8-18 |
| Charisma | 8-18 |
| Promo Skills | 6-18 |
| Menace | 8-20 |
| Drive | 10-20 (must be high) |
| Legitimacy | 6-16 |

### Hardcore Tags

| Tag | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| Bleeder | Blades/bleeds naturally |
| Bump Machine | Takes huge bumps for pops |
| Bloodthirsty | Prefers violent spots |
| Hardcore Folk Hero | Cult-like following |
| Dangerous Worker | High injury risk |
| Deathmatch Specialist | Excels in deathmatches |
| High Pain Threshold | Works through injuries |

### Career Dynamics

- **Injury Risk:** Far higher long-term

- **Mainstream Push:** Harder unless reworked
- **Decline Curve:** Fall off younger due to accumulated damage

### Differentiation Examples

| Worker | Key Stats | Tags | Feel |
|--------|-----------|------|------|
| Onita | Brawl 16, Psych 18, Believ 17 | Deathmatch Specialist, Hardcore Folk Hero, Bleeder | Bleeding hero, sacrifice, pathos |
| New Jack | Brawl 18, Psych 8, Believ 18, Menace 20 | Garbage Brawler, Bloodthirsty, Dangerous Worker | Uncontrollable chaos, legit hurt people |
| Abdullah | Brawl 20, Psych 12, Believ 19, Menace 20 | Bloodthirsty, Deathmatch Specialist, No-Seller | Monster who stabs people |
