## Tweener (#233)

**Core Skills:** Believability (absolute must), Charisma (must draw attention without clear alignment)

**Flexible Skills:** Any in-ring style can be a tweener depending on story

**Subtypes:**
| Subtype | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Reluctant Heel | Forced into villainy | Seth Rollins Authority turn |
| Reluctant Face | Doesn't want to be hero | Eddie Kingston |
| Chaotic Neutral | Pure unpredictability | Stone Cold '97 |
| Self-Interested Opportunist | Out for themselves | Edge, MJF |
| Antihero | Dark methods, crowd support | Moxley, Cactus Jack ECW |
| Silent Tweener | Alignment unclear through silence | Asuka, early Samoa Joe |

**Fan Reaction:** Highly volatile, earned through performance not loyalty

**Era Sensitivity:** More natural post-80s, Attitude Era onwards

**Booking Notes:** Strong booking = beloved. Mishandling = rejected as fake.

## Heel Ace (#234)

**Core Skills:** Charisma (command audience), Psychology (control match flow), Overness (must be top tier in region/nation)

## Storyteller Archetype (Reference #225)

**Note:** Mostly serves as HYBRID LAYER over other archetypes. Pure storytellers are rare.

**Core Skills:** Psychology, Selling

**Examples:**
- Peak 80s Steamboat = Pure Storyteller
- Young Akiyama = Pure Storyteller
- Kobashi = Monster + Storyteller
- Bret = Technician + Storyteller
- Paul Orndorff = Heel + Storyteller (masterful heel heat segment control)

**Design Note:** Rather than a standalone archetype, Storyteller functions as a tag or modifier applied to primary archetypes.
