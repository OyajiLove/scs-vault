# KING'S ROAD ARCHETYPE

📛 **NAME:** King's Road Archetype (Oudou / 王道)  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker Classification, Skill Templates  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** king's road, oudou, AJPW, NOAH, escalation, head drops, four pillars, puroresu, tragedy  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Covers AJPW/NOAH and similar federations built on structured escalation. Matches are mythic battles where pride, endurance, and mortality are tested. Gradual escalation of violence where defeat is not the end but foundation for future victory. Distinct from Fighting Spirit in pace, psychology, and match philosophy.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Gradual escalation of violence over match duration
- Defense-focused: resist, survive, counter (vs Fighting Spirit's offense-focus)
- Predictable structure: slow base → heat phase → escalation phase → killshot phase
- Head drops and insane moves spike injury risk dramatically
- Defeat builds future victories: losses create story foundation
- Matches are longer, slower, cumulative damage matters
- Classical storytelling, mythmaking, mortality in-ring

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes. LLM generates commentary about escalation phases, near-death moments, cumulative damage storytelling.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol. 2 (developed as archetype, distinct from Fighting Spirit)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** [[Worker_Skills]], [[Hidden_Personality]], [[Tags_System]], [[Fighting_Spirit_Archetype]], [[Match Engine/_Match Engine Index|Match Engine]], [[Injury System/_Injury System Index|Injury System]]

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**

- Exact phase transition thresholds?
- Head drop injury probability modifiers by era?
- How does King's Road DNA interact with Fighting Spirit DNA in cross-promotion matches?
- Choshu influence: when did aggression/tempo updates integrate?

✅ **STATUS:** Locked (Vol 2)

## SUBTYPES

### Main Event Tier

| Subtype | Core Concept | Examples |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Orange Crush** | Idealistic, fiery young ace-in-training who absorbs brutal punishment but refuses to quit. The burning spirit kid earning love through struggle. | Young Kenta Kobashi (early 90s AJPW) |
| **Iron Man** | Grizzled, mythic ace whose body absorbs unspeakable punishment and delivers devastating, match-ending lariats and death moves. Triumph through sheer endurance. Forged spirit, living monument to survival. | Late-career Kenta Kobashi (NOAH champion era) |
| **Sumo King** | Heavier, sumo-influenced wrestler using mass, striking, and grit. Less finesse, more iron will and weight-based offense. | Akira Taue, Early Genichiro Tenryu |
| **Usurper** | Cold, ruthless heir generation who threatens to overtake old guard, mixing respect and rebellion. Not literally second-gen but heir generation after established aces. | Jun Akiyama |
| **Hard-Luck Hero** | Beloved but often tragic figure. Consistently fights valiantly but falls short until career redemption arcs. | Tamon Honda, post-peak Misawa after 1999 |

### Junior/Flash Tier

| Subtype | Core Concept | Examples |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Ark Genius** | Flashy, brilliant juniors mixing speed, crisp striking, and clever match construction into a graceful, calculating package. They embody the beauty of junior heavyweight evolution. Named for NOAH's "Genius of the Ark" legacy. | Naomichi Marufuji, Kotaro Suzuki (early NOAH), Koji Kanemoto (lighter version) |
| **Brash Prodigy** | Young, cocky worker full of flash and spirit but lacking emotional depth early on. Evolves through matches into grittier warrior. | KENTA (young NOAH), early Kanemaru |

### Midcard/Support Tier

| Subtype | Core Concept | Examples |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Fiery Underdog** | Small but mighty, scrappy and beloved for visible struggle against bigger foes. Crowd belovedness is core trait. | Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, Masanobu Fuchi (certain eras) |
| **Hardheaded Underdog** | Smaller, tougher wrestlers who get mauled but refuse collapse. Distinct from Fiery Underdog: more about sheer stubbornness and physical durability over crowd belovedness. | Makoto Hashi, Akitoshi Saito (early NOAH before heel turn) |
| **Heavy Bruiser** | Big-bodied youthful strikers, raw but dangerous. Covers types who aren't Vader-level monsters but are still blunt instruments. | Takeshi Morishima, Takeshi Rikio |
| **Undercard Striver** | Middle-tier, earnest fighters trying to break upward. Dependable but not destined for top-tier greatness unless they break expectations. Covers the "coulda been" types. | Takao Omori (mid-career), Jun Izumida |

### Veteran Tier

| Subtype | Core Concept | Examples |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Senior Circuit Hero** | Beloved old warriors working comedy or nostalgia matches in openers, earning pops through character, timing, and affection. Critical for sim world aging and nostalgia booking. | Rusher Kimura, Eigen, Great Kojika |

**Note:** Black Tank renamed to Iron Man (Vol 2) to better capture Kobashi's mythic "Iron Man" nickname and the forged-spirit essence of late NOAH heavyweight championship era.

## MATCH DNA: KING'S ROAD

| Element | Game Implementation |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Structured Escalation Engine** | Matches have phases: base phase → heat phase → escalation phase → killshot phase |
| **Accumulated Damage Tracking** | System measures limb/body core injury; must visibly wear down opponent over time |
| **Injury Risk Spike** | Big head drops and insane moves massively spike injury chance |
| **Crescendo Psychology** | Crowd heat builds steadily but explodes at escalation stage |
| **Last Stand Spirit Tag** | Huge final gasp comebacks at 80-90% injury but few survive it twice |

**In gameplay terms:** Matches feel like building a tragedy. Fans anticipate escalation, they dread it, they hope the hero survives.

## KING'S ROAD VS. FIGHTING SPIRIT

| Aspect | King's Road (AJPW/NOAH) | Fighting Spirit (NJPW) |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Pace | Slower build, gradual escalation | Higher tempo, aggressive, urgent |
| Offense vs Defense | Defense-focused (resist, survive, counter) | Offense-focused (attack, dominate, overwhelm) |
| Match Flow | Predictable structure: slow base → injury tease → big escalation | Less predictable, finishes can happen at any point |
| Move Philosophy | Big escalation, head drops, exhaustion finishes | Submissions and strikes credible at all times |
| Emotion | Spirit shown through enduring increasing punishment step-by-step | Spirit shown in sudden survival, desperate comebacks |
| Injury Risk | Extremely high in final escalation stages | Moderate, tied to submission damage or KO |
| Psychology | Classical storytelling, mythmaking, mortality in-ring | Martial arts/military realism emphasis |

**Summary:** King's Road = Tragedies. Fighting Spirit = Fights.

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### Head Drop Escalation (1990s)

The head drop phenomenon evolved naturally through the decade:
- Late 80s/Early 90s: Relatively minimal
- Mid 90s: Began escalating as workers survived more moves
- Late 90s: Natural consequence of showing guts and building on past defeats
- Workers pushed boundaries to overcome previous losses
- Misawa's death (2009) represented the tragic endpoint of this philosophy

### Choshu Influence

When Riki Choshu came to AJPW, he updated the style with:
- Increased aggression
- Higher tempo
- This created the bridge between older NWA-influenced King's Road and the explosive 90s version

---

## BOOKING BEHAVIOR

- Expect long matches with gradual escalation
- Title matches should be wars, not sprints
- Losses can build stars when handled heroically
- Near-falls create drama and investment
- Head drops and dangerous moves should be rare but impactful
- Series matches benefit from escalating stakes

---

## CAREER ARC

**Early Career:** Young lion taking punishment, proving heart (Orange Crush)  
**Rising:** Building credibility through losses, earning fan investment  
**Prime:** Escalation wars, title reigns, carrying the style  
**Late Career:** Transitioning to mentor role, or Hard-Luck Hero arc, or broken legend

---

## DESIGN NOTES

### King's Road vs. Other Puroresu Styles

- **King's Road:** AJPW/NOAH structured tragedy
- **Fighting Spirit:** NJPW aggressive martial arts realism
- **Muga:** Technical purity, ego-death wrestling
- **Junior Puroresu:** Speed and spectacle within puroresu framework

### Injury System Integration

King's Road matches should have:
- Higher baseline injury risk in escalation phases
- Head drop moves flagged as high-risk
- Cumulative damage tracking across match
- Career-threatening injury potential in main events

---

## FLAVOR TEXT

"In King's Road, wrestling is not a fight: it is a pilgrimage through suffering. Every match is a testament to endurance, every victory paid for in blood, every loss a seed of future glory. The road is paved with broken bodies, but its destination is immortality."
