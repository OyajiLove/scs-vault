# DARK WEAVER ARCHETYPE

📛 **NAME:** Dark Weaver Archetype  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Character Style, Worker Classification  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** dark weaver, mind games, psychological, cult leader, serpent, manipulator, creeper  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Psychological predators who conquer souls rather than bodies. They dismantle belief, sow doubt, and corrode hope. Victory is mental before physical. These are not Showmen performing for pops, not Monsters scaring through size, not Heel Aces dominating through skill: they are a distinct breed who wrestle with fear, psychology, and manipulation.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Focus is on storytelling, emotion, and aura of threat
- Victory is mental before physical
- Matches are slow but loaded with meaning
- Promo/storytelling skills are primary weapon
- Can be face, heel, or tweener depending on target
- Effectiveness tied to opponent's emotional vulnerability

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes. LLM generates psychological warfare promos, cryptic warnings, emotional manipulation sequences.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol. 2 (new archetype, workshopped from mind-games discussion)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** [[Worker_Skills]], [[Hidden_Personality]], [[Tags_System]], [[Heel_Ace_Archetype]], [[Promo System/_Promo System Index|Promo System]]

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**

- Fear Aura implementation: morale penalty formula?
- Psychological Trap interaction with match engine?
- How does Dark Weaver DNA interact with Showman DNA (Broken Entertainer crossover)?

✅ **STATUS:** Locked (Vol 2)

## SUBTYPES

| Subtype | Core Concept | Examples |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Cult Leader** | Gathers followers to enact violent or spiritual "revolutions." Leads lost souls through charisma and terror. Power comes from the collective. | Bray Wyatt (Wyatt Family), Kevin Sullivan (Dungeon of Doom), Father James Mitchell |
| **Cold Blood** | Slimy, deadly manipulators who strike emotionally. Loners who dismantle one victim at a time. Patient, coiled, reptilian stillness. | Jake Roberts, early Undertaker (psychology era) |
| **Outcast** | Embodies alienation, resentment, emotional decay. Lashes out against perceived societal betrayal. The broken soul who breaks others. | Raven, early Darby Allin (dark psychology side), Malakai Black |
| **Broken Prophet** | Believes they have transcendent truth but are visibly unhinged. Delivers cryptic warnings of doom. Unstable mystics. | Waylon Mercy, post-broken Bray Wyatt, early Ministry Undertaker |
| **Dark Trickster** | Uses dark humor, irony, and fatalism to emotionally disarm others before striking. Unpredictable and unnerving. Laughter as weapon. | Danhausen (dark side), Joker Sting, early Edge (mind games era) |

## ASSOCIATED TAGS

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| **Fear Aura** | Opponents suffer morale penalties in feuds with strong Dark Weavers |
| **Psychological Trap** | Increases match effectiveness when opponent is booked after a pre-match promo segment (softening them emotionally) |
| **Slow Death** | Matches build slowly but devastatingly if booking allows space (non-squash structure) |
| **Whispering Killer** | Quiet menace that builds over time: less screaming, more impact |
| **Corrupter** | Can turn allies against each other through manipulation |

---

## BOOKING BEHAVIOR

- Promo time is essential: these workers need mic segments to build threat
- Matches should be paced slower with psychological storytelling
- Pre-match promos increase effectiveness
- Best feuds are long-burn psychological warfare
- Often work better as final boss of multi-match arc
- Can elevate babyfaces by making them overcome fear

### Era Sensitivity

| Era | Importance |
|-----|------------|
| Territory Era | Occasional use, cult/voodoo gimmicks |
| 1980s WWF | Jake Roberts stands alone |
| Attitude Era | High (Undertaker Ministry, Raven, Mankind psychology) |
| 2000s-2010s | Variable, tends toward supernatural gimmicks |
| Modern Era | Resurgence (Bray Wyatt, Malakai Black, House of Black) |

## DESIGN NOTES

### Dark Weaver vs. Other Archetypes

**vs. Heel Ace:**
Heel Aces dominate through skill, charisma, and championship-level credibility. Dark Weavers dominate through psychological warfare. A Heel Ace like Flair makes you feel inferior. A Dark Weaver like Jake makes you feel afraid.

**vs. Monster:**
Monsters use size and physical menace. Dark Weavers use psychological menace. Yokozuna scares you with his mass. Jake scares you with his words.

**vs. Showman (Broken Entertainer):**
Some crossover exists with Broken Entertainer (Broken Matt Hardy, Firefly Funhouse Bray). The distinction: Broken Entertainers are postmodern/comedic first with darkness as flavor. Dark Weavers are darkness first with possible comedic elements as weapon.

### Archetype Name Workshop (Vol 2)

Considered alternatives before locking Dark Weaver:
- Serpents (too Jake-specific)
- Corrupters (too aggressive)
- Whisperers (softer, haunting)
- Tempters (too religious)
- Shadowspeakers (too mystical)

**Dark Weaver** chosen for: poetic, mythic, implies spinning dark fates through words and deeds.

## FLAVOR TEXT

"Some conquer with fists. Some with steel. These dark hearts conquer the soul. They dismantle belief, sow doubt, and corrode hope. To fight them is not just to battle: it is to survive the poisoning of your spirit."

"They don't shout. They don't rush. They whisper fears into the cracks of your mind until you crumble. The Dark Weaver doesn't just beat you: they dismantle you piece by piece."
