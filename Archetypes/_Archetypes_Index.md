# ARCHETYPES SYSTEM

📛 **NAME:** Archetypes System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker Classification, Skill Templates  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** archetypes, worker types, core skills, subtypes, style classification  
📝 **SUMMARY:**

Archetypes define a worker's fundamental identity and required skill ranges. Each archetype has mandatory core skills (no exceptions) and suggested ranges for other attributes. Archetypes are not visible to players but inform worker behavior, booking AI, and crowd expectations.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Every worker is assigned 1-2 archetypes
- Archetypes set minimum core skill requirements
- Subtypes provide further specialization within archetypes
- Archetypes influence hidden personality defaults and tag assignments
- Workers can evolve between archetypes over career (rare, major shift)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol. 1 (extracted archetypes), Vol. 3-4 (refinement)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** [[Worker_Skills]], [[Hidden_Personality]], [[Tags_System]], Match Engine

✅ **STATUS:** LOCKED (Vol 1 extraction complete)

## CORE RULE (LOCKED)

**Every archetype MUST have mandatory minimum core skills.**

- Core skills = archetypal essence (no exceptions)
- Recommended ranges = flexible for other stats
- Odd stats can go outside prescribed ranges, but core skills CANNOT
- Without core skills, you're just cosplay

## ARCHETYPE ASSIGNMENT

### At Worker Creation

1. Determine primary style/region
2. Assign primary archetype based on skills
3. Optionally assign secondary archetype (hybrid workers)
4. Assign subtype based on specific skill distribution
5. Generate appropriate tags

### During Career

- Archetypes rarely change (major career shift required)
- Subtypes can evolve more fluidly
- Example: High Flyer → Aging Flyer Hybrid after injuries

---

## DESIGN NOTES

### Archetypes Are Not Gimmicks

Archetype = wrestling style and capability  
Gimmick = character presentation

A Technician can be a face, heel, cowboy, vampire, or anything else. The archetype describes HOW they wrestle, not WHO they are.

### Overlap Is Expected

Many workers fit multiple archetypes:
- Bret Hart: Technician + Storyteller elements
- Kobashi: Monster + Storyteller elements
- Hansen: Brawler + Wildcard elements

Primary archetype determines core expectations; secondary adds depth.
