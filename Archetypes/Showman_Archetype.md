## DESIGN NOTES

### Showman vs. Charismatic Entertainer

Vol 1's Charismatic Entertainer was a 6-subtype foundation. Vol 2's Showman expands this to 16 subtypes covering:
- 80s cartoon characters
- 90s New Generation occupational gimmicks
- Attitude Era broken/wild characters
- 2000s Ruthless Aggression sports entertainer dominance
- Modern NXT/Performance Center athletic entertainer boom

### Model Appeal Tag

Workers with mainstream beauty/fitness model backgrounds receive automatic boosts in marketing/brand appeal, social media growth, and audience casual interest, even if their matches are bad. Doesn't guarantee "wrestling" success but brings clear advantages.

Examples: Stacy Keibler, Torrie Wilson, Mandy Rose, Early Trish Stratus

## FLAVOR TEXT

"In every era, the Showman has adapted: from neon superheroes to broken dreamers, from polished entertainers to surging athletic prodigies. Wrestling's beating heart isn't always the three-count. It's the moments we remember, the stories that never leave us."
