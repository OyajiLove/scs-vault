## Key Insight

**Storyteller is NOT a pure standalone archetype.** It's a **Hybrid Layer** that overlays other archetypes, enhancing emotional depth and match narrative quality.

---

## Defining Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Psychology Focus** | Logical match flow, callbacks to previous spots/feuds, deliberate pacing |
| **Selling Matters Deeply** | Emotional investment through believable pain and struggle |
| **Emotion > Movez** | Story impact prioritized over flashy execution |
| **Match Stakes** | Even minor matches feel weighty, consequences matter |

---

## Hybrid Examples

| Wrestler | Base Archetype + Storyteller |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Kenta Kobashi | Monster + Storyteller |
| Bret Hart | Technician + Storyteller |
| Eddie Guerrero | Charismatic Entertainer + Storyteller |
| Toshiaki Kawada | Defiant Soul + Storyteller |
| Ricky Steamboat | High Flyer + Storyteller |
| Paul Orndorff | Charismatic Brawler + Storyteller |
| Tommy Dreamer | Hardcore + Storyteller |

## Mechanical Implementation

Storyteller is expressed through:

1. **High Psychology stat** (16+)
2. **High Selling stat** (16+)
3. **Tags:** "Psychology Monster", "Ring General", "Match Architect", "Callback Master"
4. **Match quality bonus** when psychology and selling combine
5. **Feud depth bonus** for long-running storylines

---

## When to Apply

A worker qualifies for Storyteller Hybrid when:

- Psychology 16+ AND Selling 16+
- OR Psychology 18+ regardless of selling
- OR has "Psychology Monster" or equivalent tag

---

## Design Philosophy

> "The best wrestlers don't just perform moves, they tell stories. Every hold, every strike, every sell has meaning. The audience doesn't just watch; they feel."

---

## Not Standalone

Workers should NOT be assigned "Storyteller" as their primary archetype. It modifies how their base archetype plays out:

- **Technician + Storyteller:** Technical sequences that build drama, not just exchanges
- **Monster + Storyteller:** Destruction with emotional weight, not mindless squashes
- **High Flyer + Storyteller:** Spots that mean something, not just spectacle
