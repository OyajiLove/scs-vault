| Stern Frontliner | Grittier, grimier | Takada after UWF |

**Tags:** Iron Will (exceptional resistance to cumulative fatigue across tournaments/title runs, but if pushed too far = catastrophic injuries)

**Fan Reaction:** Drawn to them for perseverance not flash. Massive loyalty and respect over time.

**Fan Reaction:** Intense sympathy, emotional investment, bittersweet attachment. Fighting fate itself.

**Character Notes:** Never the "chosen one." Scratch, claw, bleed, maybe touch greatness once or twice.
