## Design Notes

### Vol 2 Terminology Note

Vol 2 discussed renaming "Fighting Spirit Hero" subtype to "Heartfelt Hero" to avoid overlap with the Fighting Spirit archetype. The Vol 1 subtype list above is more comprehensive; "Heartfelt Hero" maps most closely to **Gritty Battler** (emotional resilience, fighting through pain).

Rejected alternatives: Never-Say-Die Hero, Resilient Champion, Iron-Willed Hero, Battling Hero.

## Era Sensitivity

|-----|-----------|
| Territory Era | Core archetype, simple heroes |
| 1990s | Harder sell, fans want edge |
| Attitude Era | Nearly extinct (antiheroes rule) |
| Modern | Comeback viable, must be authentic |
