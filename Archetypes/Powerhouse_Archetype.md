# POWERHOUSE ARCHETYPE

📛 **NAME:** Powerhouse Archetype  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Physical Style, Worker Classification  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** powerhouse, power, strength, dominant, big man, impressive  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Overwhelming physical dominance. Focuses on strength, power, intimidation. Visual impact first: fans pop for lifts, slams, feats of strength, squash matches, brutal finisher impact. Can be babyface, heel, or tweener: power is the gimmick. Often transitional champions, dominant midcard champions, monster slayers, or big fight attractions.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Power and believability are non-negotiable core skills
- Awe, fear, or explosive catharsis when toppled
- Powerhouses dominate until exhausted, broken, or outsmarted
- Many flame out due to injury (roid-related or otherwise)
- Psychology and basics often rough unless evolved later
- Visual impact drives crowd reaction

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes. LLM describes feats of strength, dominant offense, big impact moments.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol. 2 (new archetype)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** [[Worker_Skills]], [[Hidden_Personality]], [[Tags_System]], [[Monster_Giant_Archetypes]], [[Injury System/_Injury System Index|Injury System]]

## CORE SKILLS (MANDATORY)

| Skill | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Power** | Very High (Core) | Strength feats, intimidating presence |
| **Believability** | Very High (Core) | Without it, looks silly and cartoonish |
| **Brawling** | Medium-High | Natural extension: stiff strikes, clubbing blows |
| **Charisma** | Medium | Separates top guys (Goldberg, Batista) from filler |
| **Durability** | Low-Medium | Variable: many breakdowns, bad gas tanks |
| **Psychology** | Low | Varies heavily by worker |
| **Basics** | Low | Often clunky unless evolved later |

### Why This Skill Balance?

| Trait | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Power | Obvious: strength feats, intimidating presence |
| Believability | Fans need to feel you could actually dominate |
| Brawling | Natural extension of power: stiff strikes |
| Charisma | Helps separate top guys from filler monsters |
| Durability | Highly variable: roid injuries, gas tanks |
| Psychology/Basics | Often rough unless properly carried/booked |

## SUBTYPES

| Subtype | Core Concept | Examples |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Juggernaut** | Unstoppable offensive machine. Constant, relentless power. | Goldberg (WCW era), early Brock Lesnar |
| **Freak Athlete** | Unreal athletic gifts combined with size and strength. Freakishly quick AND freakishly strong. Scary hybrid guys who can run 40s in crazy time and deadlift 500 pounds. | Brian Cage, early Bobby Lashley, Oba Femi |
| **Grizzled Strongman** | Traditional big bruisers who rely on "tough man" contests. Pride in toughness. Old-school brute strength. | Jim Duggan, early Ron Simmons, Stan Hansen (power side) |
| **Squash Monster** | Built for short, devastating matches. Used to shock and awe crowds, sometimes as gatekeepers. Domination specialists. | Ryback, early Braun Strowman, Umaga (early) |
| **Big Fight Specialist** | Powerhouses who specialize in peaking for big showdowns. Great at promos, weigh-ins, big-match feel. Major event, marquee powerhouses. | Batista, Brock Lesnar (later), Drew McIntyre (post-comeback) |

### Potential Future Tags

## FLAVOR TEXT

"Strength alone isn't enough. In the world of the Powerhouse, you must make them believe: in your dominance, your fury, your inevitability. Without that, you're just another big man waiting to fall."
