## ADDITIONAL SEGMENT TYPES

### On-Location (Guerrilla Style)

**Description:** Cheap and dirty on-location attacks filmed documentary-style. Cameraman follows workers into real-world settings for ambushes.

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Horsemen gas station attack | Flair and co. commandeer cameraman, film Rhodes beatdown at gas station |
| Outsiders driving Steiners off road | Mobile attack, filmed from pursuing vehicle |
| Dreamer/Raven warehouse brawl | Gritty, low-production ECW style |
| Dusty Rhodes rodeo attack | Real-world location invasion |

**Variables:**
- Production cost: LOW (just need camera crew)
- Authenticity feel: HIGH
- Injury risk: MODERATE (less controlled environment)
- Buzz potential: HIGH if unexpected
- Spectacle Decay: Slower than produced stunts

---

### Training Vignettes

**Description:** Rocky-style montages showing worker development, comeback preparation, or mentorship.

**Use Cases:**
- Injury comeback build
- Young lion development showcase
- Mentor/protégé relationship building
- New skill acquisition storyline

**Variables:**
- Production cost: MODERATE
- Time investment: Usually shown over multiple weeks
- Payoff: Increases credibility when worker returns/debuts new moves

---

### Reunion / Forgiveness Segments

**Description:** Post-feud emotional reconciliation. Former rivals or partners reconnect.

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Golden Lovers embrace | Omega/Ibushi years-long separation ends |
| Zayn/Owens reunion | Brotherhood restored after betrayals |
| Hart Foundation reunions | Family bonds renewed |

**Variables:**
- Requires prior feud history (no memory = no impact)
- Crowd investment tied to [[Feud_Memory_Tracker|Feud Memory]]
- Can trigger massive pops if properly earned
- Risk: Feels hollow if rushed or unearned

---

### Public Apology

**Description:** Worker (usually heel turning face, or face who did wrong) makes public amends.

**Use Cases:**
- Angle reset
- Cowardice moment (heel fake apology)
- Heat generator (insincere apology backfires)
- Redemption arc kickoff

**Variables:**
- Sincerity vs performance affects crowd reaction
- Can be interrupted for attack angle
- [[Melodramatic]] tag workers may overdo these

---

### Press Conference

**Description:** Kayfabe media interaction. More common in Japan, growing in AEW/modern era.

**Variables:**
- Shoot elements possible
- Controversy potential high
- Can break kayfabe or reinforce it
- Formal setting increases stakes feel

---

## ADDITIONAL SEGMENT INPUT: INJURY RISK

📌 **Source:** Vol 2 Chunk 10

### Core Mechanic

High stunts and dangerous segments carry calculated injury risk. Risk level affects:
- Insurance/medical costs
- Scandal potential if injury occurs
- Fan sympathy or horror
- Backstage heat if botched without payoff

### Injury Risk Levels

| Level | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Safe** | Fully protected, minimal risk | Crash pad table bump backstage |
| **Low** | Standard wrestling risk | Normal beatdown, careful brawl |
| **Moderate** | Some danger present | Parking lot fight, unprotected chairs |
| **High** | Significant injury potential | Cage drops, fire proximity |
| **Extreme** | Major risk, requires medical standby | Powerbomb to concrete, high falls with minimal padding |

### Risk Modifiers

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Worker durability | High durability = lower risk |
| Match fatigue | Fatigued workers = higher risk |
| Medical staff presence | Reduces consequence severity |
| Booking pressure | Some promoters push unsafe spots |
| Prior injury tags | Pre-existing injuries increase risk |

### Example: Hawk/Titantron Spot (1998)

- **Apparent Risk:** EXTREME (falling off giant structure)
- **Actual Risk:** MODERATE (huge crash pad behind tron)
- **Fan Perception:** EXTREME danger = massive drama
- **System Tracks:** Both perceived and actual risk levels

---

## ADDITIONAL SEGMENT OUTCOME: AUDIENCE FRAGMENTATION

📌 **Source:** Vol 2 Chunk 10

### Core Concept

Some segments don't get unified crowd response. Instead, the audience **splits**:
- Some fans love it
- Others hate it
- Some feel betrayed
- Some are confused

### Trigger Conditions

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Controversial worker action** | HBK "loses smile" (1997) |
| **Tone mismatch with fanbase** | "We solved racism" Cody promo |
| **Alignment confusion** | Austin refusing to help Bret |
| **Meta-commentary** | Omega's Elite drama promos |
| **Polarizing delivery** | Cena speeches to split crowds |

### System Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Buzz Impact** | May increase (controversy = attention) |
| **Trust Impact** | May decrease (confusion damages faith) |
| **Memory Impact** | Segment remembered, but as divisive |
| **Future Reactions** | Crowd stays fragmented on this worker/angle |

### Tracking

```
Audience Split:
- % Positive: 45%
- % Negative: 35%
- % Confused: 20%

Fragmentation Severity: MODERATE
Memory Type: Divisive Moment
```

### Key Insight

> These segments don't die. They echo, but they fracture.

Fragmentation isn't always bad, can increase buzz while hurting trust. But **repeated fragmentation** damages long-term credibility.
