## Stage Transition Triggers

| Established → Peak | Dominant run, industry-defining moment, crossover success |
| Peak → Decline | Age, injuries, staleness, new stars rising |
| Any → Crisis | Major scandal, career-threatening injury, public meltdown |
| Crisis → Reinvention | Successful return, persona change, redemption booking |
| Decline → Legacy | Semi-retirement, special attraction booking, industry respect |
