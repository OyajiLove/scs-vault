## Overview

Fanbase DNA must exist. Not all fans are the same. Not all regions are the same. Not all eras are the same.

**Core Truth:** Scandals land differently everywhere. Workers can survive in some pockets while burning alive in others.

---

## Fanbase DNA Attributes

Each promotion and region carries a demographic profile with these attributes:

| Attribute | Description | Scandal Impact |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Age Skew** | Younger, Older, Mixed | Younger = more scandal sensitive; Older = more tolerant or oblivious |
| **Political Lean** | Conservative, Liberal, Libertarian, Socialist, Apolitical | Determines which scandals matter and which are shrugged off |
| **Gender Balance** | Male-heavy, Female-heavy, Balanced | Affects scandal reactions (sexism, harassment hits harder with female audience) |
| **Ethnic/Regional Sensitivities** | Local demographic composition | Racism scandals hit harder in diverse areas |
| **Education Level** | Lower, Middle, Higher | Higher education = more media savvy, quicker to judge hypocrisy |
| **Income Level** | Working class, Middle class, Wealthy | Affects loyalty style and corporate PR sensitivity |
| **Core Values** | Purity, Authenticity, Loyalty, Freedom, Respect, Strength, Family | Scandals attacking core values hit exponentially harder |
| **Media Consumption Culture** | Talk radio, Podcasts, Social media, Print newsletters | Affects how fast/viral scandal reactions spread |

---

## Example Promotion Fanbase DNA

| Promotion | Fanbase DNA Profile |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **WWE (2020s)** | Younger PG fans + Boomer nostalgia fans + Families; Apolitical to conservative lean; Moderate education; Family-friendly values |
| **AEW (2020s)** | 18-35 crowd; Liberal lean; Higher education skew; Higher income skew; Social media natives; Care more about social justice issues |
| **NJPW (2000s)** | Male-heavy; Conservative to moderate; Respect for tradition; Extremely low tolerance for drug, cheating, and "loss of face" scandals |
| **ECW (1995)** | 18-30 male-heavy; Libertarian/outlaw culture; Extremely high scandal tolerance (unless betrayal of "family" loyalty) |
| **Joshi Promotions (90s)** | Mixed gender; Young female-heavy base; Idol culture influence; Very high backlash for "purity" scandals like affairs, cheating |
| **Joshi (2020s)** | Male-heavy; Older skew; Moderate politics; Tolerant of misogyny; Sexual harassment = bigger internal blowback than public outrage |

---

## Regional Cultural DNA

Beyond promotion-specific profiles, regions carry baseline cultural attitudes:

| Regional DNA Attribute | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Majority Demographic** | Racial/ethnic groups dominating territory's audience |
| **Political Lean** | Region's baseline politics |
| **Cultural Taboos** | Certain scandals hit harder depending on culture |
| **Economic Status** | Working class, middle class, wealthy region |
| **Religious/Moral Influence** | Bible Belt cares about "sin" scandals; secular areas don't |
| **Historical Baggage** | Past events (civil rights, immigration, wars) affect sensitivity |

---

## Japan-Specific Scandal Sensitivity

Japanese wrestling has specific cultural scandal patterns:

| Scandal Type | Japan Response | US/Canada Response |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Sex/Cheating Scandals** | HUGE deal, "loss of face" | Moderate, varies by era |
| **Drug Scandals** | Career death, banned from country | Era-dependent, modern = serious |

| **Financial Scandals** | Very serious | Very serious |
| **Disrespecting Traditions** | Unforgivable | Depends on fanbase |

---

## International Fanbase Composition

Modern promotions have transnational fanbases:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fanbase Composition %** | Each promotion has breakdown of where fans are from |
| **Regional Scandal Filters** | When scandal happens, each region evaluates separately |
| **Split Fallout** | Japan may forgive faster, US may nuke loyalty (or vice versa) |
| **Multi-PR Strategy** | Players can handle PR regionally (apologize in US, stay silent in Japan) |
| **Growth/Risk Dynamic** | Going international = more reach, harder to control scandal reactions |

### Example Fanbase Composition

| Promotion | Japan | US | Europe | Rest |
|-----------|-------|-----|--------|------|
| **Stardom (2020s)** | 70% | 20% | 5% | 5% |
| **WWE (2020s)** | 5% | 55% | 20% | 20% |
| **NJPW (2020s)** | 65% | 20% | 10% | 5% |
| **AEW (2020s)** | 5% | 70% | 15% | 10% |

### Multi-Region Scandal Example

**Stardom Top Star caught doing drugs in US:**

| Region | % of Fanbase | Reaction |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Japan (70%) | HUGE scandal, massive shame, possible career death |
| US (20%) | Mostly forgiven ("weed is legal in half the country") |
| Europe (10%) | Minor backlash depending on country |

**Result:** Stardom loses Japanese sponsors, US growth barely affected, locker room morale splits regionally.
