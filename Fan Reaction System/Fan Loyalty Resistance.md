# Fan Loyalty Resistance System

📛 **SYSTEM:** Fan Loyalty Resistance  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Scandal Response / Fan Behavior  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** loyalty, backlash, fans, scandal tolerance, era, star power, institutional protection  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Determines how quickly and severely fans react to scandals based on fanbase type, star power, promotion size, scandal severity, and era. Not all fans are equally forgiving, and not all stars are equally protected.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Fan loyalty varies by fanbase type (hardcore loyalists vs indie critics)
- Star power creates protective buffer against backlash
- Large promotions generate more blind loyalty than small ones
- Earlier eras (70s-90s) more forgiving than modern social media era
- Scandal severity determines baseline damage
- Big stars and big promotions can survive scandals that would destroy smaller entities

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal
- Generates fan reaction narratives
- Creates social media backlash flavor text

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 2 Chunk 05 (Scandal and Fan Backlash discussion)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Scandal Types]] (provides scandal severity input)
- [[Era-Based Response]] (era modifiers)
- [[Public Image Impact]] (output feeds into this)
- [[Star Protection System]] (overlapping mechanics)
- [[Crowd_Memory|Crowd Memory]] (fan perception shifts)

## VERSION HISTORY

**Version 1.0 (Vol 2 Chunk 05) [CURRENT - LOCKED]**
- Fan loyalty resistance formula established
- Fanbase types defined with tolerance levels
- Star power and promotion size modifiers
- Era sensitivity scaling
- Institutional protection mechanics

## Core Formula

```
Fan Resistance % = (Base Loyalty) + (Star Power Modifier) + (Promotion Size Modifier) 
                   – (Scandal Severity Modifier) – (Era Outrage Modifier)
```

### What This Determines

| Outcome | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| Scandal "bounces off" | 70%+ resistance |
| Minor damage, survives | 50-69% resistance |
| Significant damage, career threat | 25-49% resistance |
| Immediate collapse, career destroyed | Below 25% resistance |

---

## Fanbase Types & Scandal Tolerance

| Fanbase Type | Base Loyalty | Scandal Tolerance | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Hardcore Company Loyalists | 75% | High | Will defend stars unless "murder-level" bad (classic WWE zombies, NJPW lifers) |
| Indie Hardcore Fans | 30% | Very Low | Will turn on stars seen as "hypocrites" fast; authenticity is everything |
| Family-Friendly Fans | 55% | Very Low | Scandals involving children, drugs, abuse kill stars instantly |
| Deathmatch Outlaw Fans | 25% | Medium-High | Care more about "authenticity"; scandal secondary unless cowardly |
| Lucha Traditionalists | 65% | Medium | Protect local icons longer than outsiders |
| Joshi Superfans | 60% | Low | Purity matters; betrayals and sleaze are devastating |
| Edgy Attitude Era Types | 45% | Medium-High | Love antiheroes, tolerate bad behaviour if it feels "badass" |

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Top Star in 1986 NWA

**Scenario:** Top face caught cheating on wife, bar fight, DUI

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fanbase: Hardcore Territorial | Base: 75% |
| Star Power: Main event | +12% |
| Promotion: Regional major | +10% |
| Scandal Severity: Moderate | -15% |
| Era: Territory | -0% |
| **TOTAL** | **82%** |

**Result:** Scandal bounces off. Minor backstage heat, no public impact.

### Example 2: Rising Indie Star in 2024

**Scenario:** Racist comments leak on social media

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fanbase: Indie Hardcore | Base: 30% |
| Star Power: Midcard | +5% |
| Promotion: Small indie | +2% |
| Scandal Severity: Serious | -30% |
| Era: Modern | -30% |
| **TOTAL** | **-23%** |

**Result:** Immediate career collapse. Fired. Blacklisted. May never recover.

### Example 3: WWE Main Eventer in 2020

**Scenario:** Sexual misconduct allegations surface

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fanbase: Hardcore Company Loyalists | Base: 75% |
| Star Power: Main event | +12% |
| Promotion: Global giant | +20% |
| Scandal Severity: Severe | -45% |
| Era: Modern | -30% |
| **TOTAL** | **32%** |

**Result:** Significant damage. Suspended. Career survives if company protects them, but perception permanently damaged. May become "controversial" tag.

## Institutional Protection Reality

**Core Truth:** Big promotions and big stars survive scandals that would destroy smaller entities.

| Reality | System Implementation |
|---------|----------------------|
| Big Stars Survive Longer | Top 1-5% names shielded by management, fans, and media bias |
| Big Promotions Survive | WWE/NJPW-level companies take PR hits but barely budge revenue |
| Fans Are Willing to Ignore | Loyalty blinds large chunks of fanbases; only sustained heat cracks it |
| Smaller Promotions Die Quicker | Indies can't survive medium scandals involving ownership or champions |
| Power Brokers Know and Hide | Executives often protect or cover up scandals internally (until leak) |

### Scandal Shielding Mechanic

Major stars and promotions have internal "cover up" chances that temporarily delay backlash:

| Entity | Cover-Up Chance | Duration |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Enhancement talent | 0% | N/A |
| Midcarder | 10% | 1-2 weeks |
| Main eventer | 30% | 1-3 months |
| Top star | 50% | 3-12 months |
| Company owner | 70% | Years (until leak) |

If cover-up fails or scandal eventually surfaces, the backlash is often WORSE due to the cover-up itself.

## Institutional Rot

Promotions can survive individual scandals, but repeated scandals accumulate:

| Rot Level | Effects |
|-----------|---------|
| 0-20% | Business as usual |
| 21-40% | Some sponsors nervous, media asks questions |
| 41-60% | Sponsor pulls, recruitment harder, morale drops |
| 61-80% | Major sponsors flee, talent exodus begins |
| 81-100% | Business collapse or forced ownership change |

Each covered-up scandal that eventually surfaces adds +10-20% to institutional rot.

## Open Questions

- [ ] Exact base loyalty values for each fanbase type (need calibration)
- [ ] Interaction with Redemption Arc system
- [ ] How long do modifiers last before fading?
