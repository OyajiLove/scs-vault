# Fan Subculture Infighting System

📛 **NAME:** Fan Subculture Infighting System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Fan Reaction System / Internal Conflict  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** subculture, infighting, fan wars, purists, crash TV, cynics, fragmentation, booking crisis  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how even during or after a Golden Era, the emotional unity that made the rise possible begins to splinter internally. Different fan archetypes prioritize different aspects of what made the boom great, leading to internal wars that can destabilize booking and end eras.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Infighting begins during Golden Era maturity, booking drift, generational change, or division wars
- 7 distinct subculture types emerge with different preferences
- Booking that pleases one group alienates others: no simple "book good matches" fix
- Internal fan wars manifest as show hijacking, online discourse poisoning, shifting merch/ratings
- Pandering to one subgroup shrinks overall reach (ROH workrate echo chamber model)

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (deterministic satisfaction calculations; LLM could generate fan discourse, social media simulation)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 191-198 (locked)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Fanbase_Cultural_Mutation]] - Creates the archetypes that fight
- [[Golden_Era_Flag_Planting]] - Infighting can end Golden Eras
- [[Fanbase_Trust_and_Betrayal]] - Infighting erodes overall trust
- [[Backstage Politics System]] - Worker factions mirror fan factions
- [[Worker_Career_Subculture_Alignment]] - Workers aligned to specific subcultures

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact satisfaction calculation per subculture
- How to model social media discourse mechanically
- Integration with Locker Room Political Mutation (half-baked)
- Subculture reconciliation mechanics (can fractured fanbases reunite?)

## 1. WHEN SUBCULTURE INFIGHTING BEGINS

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Golden Era Maturity** | As trust and emotional investment peak, subgroups start prioritizing different aspects of what made the boom great |
| **Booking Tone Drift** | If booking slowly shifts style (more humor, more shock, less prestige), loyalists fracture into camps |
| **Generational Drift** | New younger fans drawn during the boom may not value the same emotional structures as early adopters |
| **External Cultural Waves** | Shifts in broader film, music, political tone push newer emotional needs into fan consciousness |
| **Worker/Division Wars** | Different divisions (Heavyweights vs Juniors, Hardcore vs Technical) become proxy wars for fan identity |

### Trigger Thresholds

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| **Golden Era Duration** | 3+ years increases infighting probability |
| **Booking Consistency Drop** | Below 70% consistency triggers fractures |
| **Generational Gap** | 5+ years of new fan influx without cultural alignment |
| **Division Favoritism** | Significant resource imbalance between divisions |

## 2. SUBCULTURE TYPES THAT EMERGE

| Archetype | Traits | Loves | Hates |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Purists** | Love prestige arcs, protected titles, serious emotional feuds | Long matches, clean finishes, storytelling | Crash TV, cheap swerves, overbooked finishes |
| **Crash TV Fans** | Chase chaos, blood, shock moments. Pop for unpredictability. | Weapons, surprises, car crashes | Slow builds, "boring" psychology |
| **Cynics/Ironists** | Cheer swerves, mock sincerity. Love when booking undercuts emotional investment. | Meta-commentary, "gotcha" moments | Sincere emotional moments, traditional heroes |
| **Workrate Fetishists** | Worship match quality over emotional storytelling. Title prestige secondary. | Technical skill, five-star classics | Character work, "sports entertainment" |
| **Cult Loyalists** | Idolize promotion itself over booking content. Will defend no matter what. | Anything their promotion does | Criticism, outsider perspectives |
| **Heat Chasers** | Worship brutal heel runs, betrayal arcs, dominant villains | Cruelty, "realism," heel dominance | Feel-good arcs, face-heavy booking |
| **Spectacle Addicts** | Want big entrances, wild gimmicks, larger-than-life aesthetics | Grand entrances, visual spectacle | Story depth, workrate focus |

## 3. SIMULATION MECHANICS

| Behavior | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Subculture Memory Formation** | Fans remember which eras, workers, divisions represented "their" vision of wrestling |
| **Subculture Size Growth/Shrinkage** | Booking decisions (title arcs, match types, division focus) empower or erode subgroups |
| **Booking Satisfaction Modifiers** | Booking that pleases one subgroup may alienate others. No longer possible to satisfy everyone easily. |
| **Internal Fan Wars** | Fanbase becomes divided: booing golden boys, hijacking shows, online discourse poisoning locker room morale, shifting merch sales, crowd reactions, ratings patterns |
| **Promotion Cultural Drift Risk** | If leadership panders too much to one subgroup, fanbase homogenizes and overall reach shrinks |

### Satisfaction Matrix Example

| Booking Decision | Purists | Crash TV | Cynics | Workrate | Loyalists | Heat Chasers | Spectacle |
|------------------|---------|----------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Clean title defense, 25 min | +20 | -10 | -5 | +15 | +10 | -5 | -10 |
| Shock swerve title change | -15 | +20 | +15 | -5 | +5 | +10 | +5 |
| Hardcore blood match | -20 | +25 | +5 | -10 | +5 | +20 | +15 |
| Technical clinic, no drama | +10 | -15 | -10 | +25 | +5 | -15 | -20 |
| Giant spectacle entrance | -5 | +5 | -5 | -10 | +10 | 0 | +25 |

## 4. INTERNAL FAN WAR MANIFESTATIONS

| Manifestation | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| **Show Hijacking** | Fans chant against pushed workers, derail segments |
| **Golden Boy Backlash** | Workers pushed by one subculture get actively booed by others |
| **Online Discourse Poisoning** | Social media wars affect worker morale, booking confidence |
| **Merch Sales Fragmentation** | Different workers sell to different subcultures |
| **Ratings Pattern Shifts** | Segments targeting one group cause tune-out from others |
| **Live Crowd Division** | Dueling chants, split reactions, confused atmosphere |

### Hijacking Risk Factors

| Factor | Risk Increase |
|--------|---------------|
| **Large Cynical/Irony Population** | +30% hijack risk |
| **Recent Booking Disappointment** | +20% per major disappointment |
| **Smark-Heavy Venue** | +25% in certain markets |
| **Long Segment with Wrong Tone** | +15% per mismatch |

## 5. PROMOTION CULTURAL DRIFT RISK

When leadership panders too heavily to one subculture:

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| **Workrate Echo Chamber (ROH 2000s)** | Critical darling status but shrinking audience, unable to break mainstream |
| **Crash TV Overload (Late WCW)** | Casual spike then mass exodus when novelty wears off |
| **Purist Fortress (Old NWA)** | Loyal but aging audience, unable to attract new generations |
| **Spectacle Addiction (Late WCW 2)** | Style over substance, fans stop caring about outcomes |

### Echo Chamber Warning Signs

| Sign | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Declining attendance despite critical praise** | Workrate echo chamber forming |
| **Spike then crash ratings pattern** | Crash TV burnout |
| **Aging demographic, no youth influx** | Purist fortress |
| **High production values, low emotional investment** | Spectacle addiction |

## 6. HISTORICAL FAN INFIGHTING EXAMPLES

| Promotion | Fracture |
|-----------|----------|
| **WWF Late Attitude Era** | Purists wanted Bret-style technical arcs; cynics embraced crash TV |
| **AEW 2022-2024** | Split between Elite loyalists, Hangman emotional story fans, Punk working-class realism fans, and spectacle/spotfest lovers |
| **NJPW Early 2000s** | Strong style loyalists vs MMA "Inokiism" fans. Bitter civil war killed trust for years. |
| **ECW Late Era** | Hardcore deathmatch fans vs technical wrestling fans (Lance Storm, Jerry Lynn audience) arguing over true ECW "spirit" |

### AEW Post-Brawl Out Model

| Fan Archetype | Loyalty |
|---------------|---------|
| **Hangman fans** | Emotionally driven cowboy storytelling lovers |
| **Elite fans** | Style-driven athletic art fans |
| **Punk fans** | Working-class realism fans |
| **Spotfest fans** | Crash TV spectacle lovers |
| **MJF fans** | Heat chasers and antihero lovers |

All emotionally diverging even inside the same shows. Booking that pleases one group causes backlash from another.

---

## 7. WORLD MEMORY EFFECTS

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fracture Memory** | Fanbase remembered historically as fractured or unified |
| **Blame Attribution** | Golden Era endings often blamed on "bad booking" but really caused by emotional splintering |
| **Worker Career Mapping** | Worker careers affected by which fan subgroup they emotionally captured |
| **Reunion Difficulty** | Once fractured, subcultures rarely fully reunite |
