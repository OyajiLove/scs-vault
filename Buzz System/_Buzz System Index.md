# Buzz System

📛 **SYSTEM:** Buzz System
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Booking & Simulation / Momentum Tracking
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** buzz, momentum, heat, crowd response, short-term overness, popularity conversion
📝 **SUMMARY:** Buzz is a 1-20 scale momentum tracker measuring short-term crowd engagement, emotional investment, and cultural presence. It replaces the older "heat" concept with a more nuanced system that feeds into long-term [[Popularity_System|Popularity]] growth.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Buzz tracks momentum-first, with emotional, cultural, and booking-layer modifiers
- A rising Buzz score means a worker is catching fire; a falling score means audience disengagement
- Buzz is volatile (changes weekly), while Popularity is persistent (changes slowly over months/years)
- Buzz applies to: Workers (primary), Feuds, Segments, Shows, Titles, Promotions
- High sustained Buzz converts to Popularity gains over time

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal. Buzz calculations are formula-driven. LLM may assist with narrative framing of Buzz spikes/crashes in match summaries.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 (renamed from "Heat"), refined in Vol 6

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Popularity_System]] - Buzz feeds into long-term overness
- [[Fan Memory Engine/_Fan Memory Index|Fan Memory Engine]] - High Buzz moments generate Memory Snapshots
- [[Booking Trails/_Booking Trails Index|Booking Trails]] - Trails designed to build sustained Buzz
- [[Buzz System/Push Resistance|Push Resistance]] - Buzz/Pop gaps create political friction
- Title Prestige - Belt Buzz distinct from Belt Prestige

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact decay curve formula not specified
- Regional Buzz tracking rules need formalization
- Specific thresholds for "Buzz Fatigue" mechanic

✅ **STATUS:** Locked

## Mechanics in This System

- [[Buzz Scale]] - The 1-20 rating scale and what each tier means
- [[Buzz Inputs]] - Events that raise or lower Buzz
- [[Buzz Spikes and Crashes]] - Extreme momentum events
- [[Buzz to Pop Conversion]] - How sustained Buzz becomes Popularity
- [[Buzz Decay]] - How momentum fades over time
- [[Buzz by Unit]] - Tracking Buzz for workers, feuds, shows, titles

## Key Insight

**Buzz is the spark; Popularity is the fire that catches.**

One viral moment means nothing if not sustained. Consistent heat over 4-6 appearances starts converting to lasting overness.
