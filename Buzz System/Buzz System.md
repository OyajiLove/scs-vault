# Buzz System

📛 **SYSTEM:** Buzz System
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Momentum / Short-Term Heat

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 6 (lines 334-350+)
✅ **STATUS:** Locked (Core Philosophy + Decay + Spikes)

## Overview

> "Buzz builds fast. It decays faster. It burns hot, and sometimes burns out."

A short-term energy metric reflecting crowd interest, momentum, speculation, danger, unpredictability, stakes, and freshness.

---

## What Buzz Is

A short-term energy metric for:
- Workers
- Titles
- Feuds
- Segments
- Match Types

**Responsive to:**
- Match quality and outcome unpredictability
- Promos, angles, run-ins, betrayal, controversy
- Booking memory (title defenses, feud turns, weird pairings)
- Era, region, audience culture

---

## What Buzz Is NOT

- Not a replacement for Pop (long-term star power)
- Not a stat — it's a sim memory flag and heat meter
- Not guaranteed to convert into money or overness
- Not immune to burnout, backlash, or sabotage

---

## Target Structure

| Subject | Buzz Scale | Decay Rate | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| Workers | 1–20 | High | Fluctuates show-to-show. Can peak fast. May burn out or collapse if not followed through. |
| Titles | 1–20 | Medium | Builds via defenses, memorable wins/losses, champion aura. |
| Feuds/Booking Trails | 1–20 | Medium | Buzz = how much the crowd is talking about it. |
| Segments/Match Types | 1–20 or % spike | Very High | Spikes tied to event memory. Used for crowd engagement pacing. |

---

## Buzz Decay Curves

Each Buzz-holding entity has a decay profile, measured per show (or per week). Decay can be slowed, frozen, or reversed by booking activity, but never indefinitely halted.

| Entity | Base Decay Rate | Burnout Risk | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Workers | -1 to -2 per show | High | Buzz plummets fast if off-screen or cooling off. Peaks burn fast unless tied to sustained wins or angles. |
| Titles | -1 every 2–3 shows | Low–Med | Holds up longer due to memory weight. Drops fast after dull reigns, non-defenses, or flat transfers. |
| Feuds / Booking Trails | -1 per week of inactivity | Medium | Decay begins if no promo, match, run-in, or segment continuation. Climaxes without payoff cause sharper drop. |
| Teams / Factions | -1 per show if no group activity | Medium–High | Requires group presence (promos, tags, run-ins) to hold. One hot member can slow decay, but not stop it alone. |
| Promotions | -1 every 3–4 shows (global pacing) | Low | Buffers from worker and feud Buzz, but flat cards or no angles across multiple shows will cool it down. |
| Segment/Match Type | Decay = immediate after 1–2 uses | Very High | Designed to spike and vanish. Repetition lowers future Buzz gain. Abuse = burnout memory penalty. |

### Decay Stack Example (Worker)

Worker reaches Buzz 17 after a breakout feud + surprise win:
- 17 → 15 (no angle)
- 15 → 13 (still off TV)
- 13 → 11 (cold return match, no feud)
- 11 → 9 (burnout flag triggers)

**Burnout Message:** "Crowd cooled hard on [Worker]. Memory of heat faded. Need new hook."

## Burnout Flags

When Buzz decay hits a certain threshold after a peak, the system triggers a burnout state, reducing future Buzz gains unless something resets perception.

| Type | Burnout Trigger | Effect |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Worker | Drops 6+ in 3 shows | Next angle gains Buzz at half-rate |
| Feud | Spikes then stalls with no payoff | Crowds stop reacting until repackaged |
| Promotion | High Buzz → repeat booking for 3–5 shows | All Buzz gains slow until variety introduced |
| Match Type | Used more than twice in same feud/run | Flat reactions even if match quality is high |

---

## Buzz Spike Triggers

## Burnout Recovery Mechanics

When Buzz has dropped rapidly or stagnated, recovery becomes harder, but not impossible. You need a shock, a reframing, or a break.

### Worker Burnout Recovery

| Tool | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Gimmick refresh (repackage, new visuals, silence → speaker) | Resets decay, +1–3 Buzz if executed well |
| Temporary removal (injury or tour) + return swerve | Burns old Buzz decay + adds +2–5 on return |
| Redemptive arc (fall → struggle → return to form) | Staged climb, slow build — creates sustainable Buzz |
| Attach to hot feud or mentor | Piggyback +2 Buzz if crowd buys the link |

### Feud/Trail Burnout Recovery

| Tool | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Inject third party (wrench character) | +2–3 Buzz, resets expectation curve |
| Stip escalation w/ memory callback | +2 Buzz, breaks crowd fatigue |
| Meta-promo (self-aware heat drop reference) | If done right, +1–3 — can reignite interest via honesty |

### Title Burnout Recovery

| Tool | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Vacate → tournament or ceremonial crowning | Resets prestige memory, +3–5 Buzz |
| Use title as bargaining chip or grudge object | +2–3 — builds perception of worth, not just gold |
| "Undeserving champ" story with inevitable chaser | Slow burn + sustainable Buzz rise |

### Promotion Burnout Recovery

| Tool | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Change booking rhythm or show format | Temporary decay freeze |
| Cold open chaos or pulled segment | +2–4 if it genuinely surprises |
| Fire figurehead, start "new era" | +3 Buzz, but only works rarely |
| Bring in heat vacuum killer like Don Sangre | Immediate tension, +2–3 — stakes rise just by presence |
