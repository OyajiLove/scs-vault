# Worker Career Subculture Alignment System

📛 **NAME:** Worker Career Subculture Alignment System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Character System / Career Trajectory  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** career, subculture, alignment, purist, crash TV, workrate, trajectory, fan capture  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how workers rise or fall depending on which emotional fan subcultures they capture (or alienate) during an era. Workers aren't pushed or buried by skill alone: they succeed or fail based on alignment with dominant fan emotional needs.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Workers naturally or intentionally align with certain fan subcultures
- Alignment shaped by character presentation, division focus, promo style
- 7 distinct alignment paths with different trajectory risks/rewards
- Smart bookers push workers catching heat from growing subcultures
- Stagnant workers decay even without losses if fanbase emotional needs shift

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (deterministic alignment calculations; LLM could generate career narrative, fan discourse about worker)

## 1. WHEN SUBCULTURE ALIGNMENT SHAPES CAREERS

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Golden Era Maturity or Fragmentation** | Different emotional needs emerge among the fanbase. Workers naturally (or intentionally) align with some groups over others. |
| **Worker Presentation Changes** | Character tweaks, promo styles, division focus (hardcore, technical, comedy, spectacle) naturally target certain fan emotions. |
| **Booking Responses to Fan Reactions** | Smart bookers push workers catching emotional heat from growing subcultures; bad bookers misread or resist shifts. |
| **Fanbase Emotional Drift** | If a worker stays stagnant while fan emotional needs shift, career momentum decays even without losses. |

## 2. ALIGNMENT PATHS

| Alignment | Career Trajectory | Risk/Reward |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Purist Darling** | Revered during technical prestige eras | Struggles badly if crash TV or spectacle rises |
| **Crash TV King** | Rises explosively during chaos eras | Flames out brutally when fans crave narrative depth |
| **Cynical Irony Magnet** | Pops huge during irony-heavy eras (e.g., Attitude undercard) | Difficult to transition to true main event sincerity later |
| **Workrate Messiah** | Dominates modern internet-heavy discourse | May struggle connecting with casual fans if emotional storytelling isn't there |
| **Cult Loyalty Hero** | Deep bond with core fans even if mass reach is limited | Long career health but political instability risk if booking power shifts |
| **Heat Monster** | Gets huge reactions during villain eras | Can be backlash scapegoated easily if promotion trust collapses |
| **Spectacle God** | Hot streaks during aesthetic-driven eras (elaborate entrances, larger-than-life acts) | Mocked during gritty realism phases |

| **Heel/Face Dynamics Mutate** | Heels can become faces against booking intent if fans emotionally connect during emotional drift eras |

## 7. LOST STARS VS CULTURAL SURVIVORS

### Lost Star Warning Signs
