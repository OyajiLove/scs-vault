# Booker & Promoter Archetypes

📛 **NAME:** Booker & Promoter Archetypes  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Character System / AI Behavior  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** booker, promoter, archetype, AI, booking style, personality, architect, heat seeker, despot  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Archetypes that define how bookers and promoters approach booking decisions, feud structure, risk tolerance, and response to feedback. These shape AI booking behavior and provide personality to fed leadership. Archetypes can drift over time based on pressure, success, failure, or scandal.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Each booker/promoter has an archetype
- Archetype shapes: feud pacing, title booking, risk tolerance, self-correction behavior
- Drift enabled by default: archetypes can evolve over time
- Interacts with Booking Instinct, Negotiation, and Promoting/Hype stats
- Critical input for AutoBooker System

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Very High (LLM can explain booking decisions through archetype lens, generate personality-driven narratives)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 1081, 1107-1109, scattered references throughout

## Version History

| Version | Source | Status |

## Core Concept

Every booker and promoter has a **booking personality** that shapes how they:
- Structure feuds (slow burn vs hot shot)
- Handle title prestige (protect vs pop)
- Respond to crowd feedback (adapt vs stubborn)
- Take risks (conservative vs chaotic)
- Manage worker resistance (negotiate vs crush)

**Archetypes are not destiny.** They can drift over time based on pressure, success, failure, or scandal.

## AutoBooker Integration

The AutoBooker System reads archetype to determine:
- Feud placement and pacing
- Title booking philosophy
- Response to crowd feedback
- Match finish selection
- How aggressively to push or protect workers

See [[AutoBooker_System]] for full integration details.

---

## Philosophy

> "Booker archetypes aren't just labels. They're the lens through which every booking decision is filtered. An Architect and a Heat Seeker looking at the same hot feud will book it completely differently. And both might be wrong, or both might be right, depending on context."

---

## Connected Mechanics

- [[AutoBooker_System]] - primary consumer of archetype
- [[Booking_Instinct_Stat]] - skill within archetype
- [[AI_Drafting_Logic_System]] - draft personality
