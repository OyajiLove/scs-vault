# Promoting / Hype Stat

📛 **NAME:** Promoting / Hype Stat  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Character Stats / Owner-Promoter  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** promoting, hype, PR, ticket sales, buzz, brand, marketing, owner, promoter  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Stat (0-20) measuring an owner/promoter's ability to generate buzz, sell tickets, manage PR, and build brand identity. High hype = packed houses and media attention. Low hype = empty arenas despite good booking.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Scale 0-20, same as other stats
- Applies to: Owner/Promoter roles
- Affects: PR success, ticket sales, brand buzz, media coverage, sponsor interest
- Separate from Booking Instinct (you can hype garbage or fail to sell gold)

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Medium (LLM can describe promotional campaigns, media reactions, ticket sale narratives)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 line 1061

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Booking_Instinct_Stat]] - different skill, can have high one and low other
- [[Promotion_Soul_System]] - hype must align with soul or feels hollow
- [[Fan_Reaction_Memory]] - hype affects expectations
- [[Economics_Financial_System]] - directly impacts revenue

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact scale behaviors (what does 5 vs 15 look like?)
- How hype interacts with booking quality mismatch
- Regional/era modifiers

## Core Concept

Promoting/Hype measures how well an owner or promoter can:
- Generate buzz for shows and workers
- Sell tickets regardless of card quality
- Manage PR and media relationships
- Build and maintain brand identity
- Attract sponsors and media coverage

**Key distinction:** This is separate from Booking Instinct. You can be a genius booker who can't sell tickets, or a carnival barker who packs houses with garbage.

## Scale: 0-20 ✅ LOCKED

| Range | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **1-5** | Can't draw flies. Empty arenas. Media ignores the fed. Workers embarrassed to be associated. |
| **6-10** | Functional. Can fill small venues. Local media coverage. Struggles against competition. |
| **11-15** | Strong. Consistent gates. Regional buzz. Media seeks them out for quotes. |
| **16-20** | Legendary promoter. Creates events that feel like history. Sells out on name alone. Media treats every show as must-see. |

---

## What It Affects ✅ LOCKED

- **Ticket Sales:** Direct modifier on attendance
- **Brand Buzz:** How much the fed is talked about in media/fan circles
- **PR Success:** Ability to spin scandals, build narratives, control story
- **Media Coverage:** Likelihood of press, interviews, mainstream attention
- **Sponsor Interest:** Higher hype = more lucrative deals
- **Worker Recruitment:** Hot feds attract talent; cold feds struggle

## Hype vs Reality Tension

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **High Hype + Good Booking** | Golden era. Packed houses, satisfied fans, growing legend. |
| **High Hype + Bad Booking** | Short-term success, long-term trust erosion. Fans feel burned. |
| **Low Hype + Good Booking** | Hidden gem fed. Cult following but struggles financially. |
| **Low Hype + Bad Booking** | Death spiral. No one knows, no one cares. |

## Real-World Examples

| Promoter | Hype Level | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **Vince McMahon (peak)** | 18-20 | Could sell anything. Made events feel like history. |
| **Paul Heyman (ECW)** | 16-17 | Created cult buzz on no budget. Master of smoke and mirrors. |
| **Giant Baba** | 12-14 | Respected but not flashy. Let the work speak. |
| **Dixie Carter** | 8-10 | Could generate some buzz but couldn't sustain or convert to trust. |
