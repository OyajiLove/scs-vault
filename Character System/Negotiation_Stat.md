## Scale: 0-20 ✅ LOCKED

| Range | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **1-5** | Gets fleeced constantly. Signs bad contracts. Makes trades that haunt the fed for years. |
| **6-10** | Functional. Can close fair deals. Occasionally gets outmaneuvered. |
| **11-15** | Sharp. Consistently gets favorable terms. Knows when to push, when to fold. |
| **16-20** | Master dealmaker. Steals talent, wins every trade, locks workers into team-friendly deals. Other feds fear negotiating with them. |

## Negotiation in Different Contexts

| Context | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Contract Signing** | Determines who gets the better end of the deal |

| **Talent Poaching** | Convinces workers to jump ship |
| **Worker Resistance** | Can negotiate compromises instead of escalation |
| **Sponsor Deals** | Affects financial terms (with Hype stat) |

## Interaction with Other Factors

| Factor | Interaction |
|--------|-------------|
| **Desperation** | Even high negotiators make bad deals when desperate |
| **Leverage** | Having something the other side wants amplifies negotiation |
| **Relationships** | Past history (good or bad) modifies outcomes |
| **Ego (opponent's)** | High-ego opponents may reject fair deals out of pride |
| **Information** | Knowing hidden stats/situations gives advantage |

## Real-World Examples

| Person | Negotiation Level | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| **Vince McMahon** | 17-19 | Ruthless dealmaker. Locked talent into restrictive contracts. Won most trades. |
| **Paul Heyman** | 14-16 | Great at selling vision, but ECW's finances limited leverage. |
| **Bischoff (peak WCW)** | 15-17 | Turner money gave him leverage. Overpaid but got who he wanted. |
| **Dixie Carter** | 6-8 | Frequently outmaneuvered. Signed bad deals. |
| **Hogan (as talent)** | 16-18 | Negotiated creative control, favorable booking, protected finishes. |

## Workers with Negotiation Stat

Not all workers have meaningful Negotiation scores. Those who do:
- Veterans with backstage pull
- Workers with agent/producer roles
- Booking Politicians (tag)
- Those with creative control clauses
- Union organizers or locker room leaders

Workers without backstage influence default to low/no negotiation impact.
