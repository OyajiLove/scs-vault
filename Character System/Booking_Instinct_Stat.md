# Booking Instinct (Universal Stat)

📛 **NAME:** Booking Instinct  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Character Stats / Universal  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** booking, instinct, story, rhythm, IQ, committee, owner, booker, agent, wrestler  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Universal stat (0-20) measuring a character's ability to understand wrestling stories, feud structure, timing, and crowd psychology. Applies to everyone: wrestlers, road agents, bookers, owners, committee members. High instinct = genius-tier myth creation. Low instinct + power = catastrophe.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Scale 0-20, same as other stats
- Universal: wrestlers, non-wrestlers, owners, bookers, agents all have it
- Affects: Feud structure, heel/face turns, burnout prevention, match placement, title prestige protection, worker morale trajectory, committee influence
- Booking Instinct ≠ Booking Authority (you can be a legend with great instinct but no power, or a head booker with zero instinct)

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Medium (LLM can describe booking decisions influenced by instinct, explain why bad bookers make bad choices)

## Core Concept

Booking Instinct is a universal stat measuring how well someone understands wrestling stories.

**Three key truths:**
1. **Wrestlers & Road Agents Need It:** Committee members, player-facing booking tools, and talent who gain influence backstage all need to know how well someone understands wrestling stories. This affects input power.
2. **Owners Might Think They Know Best:** And sometimes they do. A high Booking Instinct owner might force an override and be right. A low-instinct one might hotshot disaster.
3. **Booking Instinct ≠ Booking Authority:** You can be a passive legend with great instinct. Or a head booker with zero instinct and everything falls apart. The stat measures story rhythm IQ, not position.

## Scale: 0-20 ✅ LOCKED

| Range | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **1-5** | Clueless. Botches escalation. Doesn't understand long-term consequences. Fails to protect belts, peaks feuds too early or not at all. |
| **6-10** | Functional. Can book decent arcs if given time. Needs guidance or help in high-pressure systems. |
| **11-15** | Sharp. Knows how to balance crowd heat, memory, and push pressure. Creates emotionally sound programs. |
| **16-20** | Genius-tier. Creates enduring myth. Knows when to hold back, when to deliver. Even mid-level pushes feel like destiny under their vision. |

## Examples by Role ✅ LOCKED

| Role | Example | Why It Matters |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Veteran Worker** | Eddie Guerrero | Offers incredible layout advice, knows how to protect talent, knows how to lose smart |
| **Road Agent** | Fit Finlay | Keeps match psychology tight and meaningful. Instinct helps refine bloated booking. |
| **Owner** | Giant Baba | Respected arc-builder. Even if not active, his instinct shaped tone for decades. |
| **Untrusted Power Figure** | Dixie Carter | Low Instinct + Power = catastrophe if not kept in check |

## Interaction with Power Structure

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| **High Instinct + High Power** | Legendary booking eras (Baba, peak Heyman, peak Gedo) |
| **High Instinct + Low Power** | Frustrated genius, gives great advice but ignored (many road agents) |
| **Low Instinct + High Power** | Disaster waiting to happen (Dixie, Russo in WCW) |
| **Low Instinct + Low Power** | Irrelevant, can't do much damage |

## Philosophy

> "Booking Instinct measures story rhythm IQ, not position. A passive legend with great instinct sees the arc. A head booker with zero instinct and all the power creates wreckage. The stat is universal because everyone in wrestling, from wrestlers to owners, either understands the story or they don't."
