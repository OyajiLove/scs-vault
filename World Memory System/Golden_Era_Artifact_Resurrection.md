## 3. SINCERITY CHECK

Resurrection attempts are evaluated for sincerity:

| Factor | Sincere Indicator | Exploitative Indicator |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Original Creators** | Involved and supportive | Excluded or opposed |
| **Presentation** | Reverent, emotional | Rushed, merchandise-focused |
| **Context** | Meaningful anniversary | Random marketing push |
| **Follow-Through** | Ongoing respect | One-time cash grab |
| **Fan Response** | Organic enthusiasm | Manufactured hype |

### Sincerity Score Calculation

```
Sincerity = (Creator_Involvement × 0.25) + (Presentation_Quality × 0.25) + 
            (Context_Appropriateness × 0.20) + (Follow_Through × 0.15) + 
            (Fan_Organic_Response × 0.15)
```

| Sincerity Score | Classification |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 80-100 | Deeply Sincere |
| 60-79 | Respectful |
| 40-59 | Neutral |
| 20-39 | Corporate |
| 0-19 | Exploitative |

## 4. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Event | Resurrection Outcome |
|-------|---------------------|
| **WWE Winged Eagle Belt Return (Speculative)** | Would cause massive nostalgia wave among Attitude Era fans. High sincerity required to avoid "cash grab" perception. |
| **NOAH Return to Budokan (2020s)** | Symbolically healing King's Road emotional connection to big-time puroresu history. Sincere, well-received. |
| **AEW Using WCW Themes/Logos Carefully** | Subtle emotional healing for disillusioned WCW fans. Respectful approach, not exploitative. |
| **WWE ECW One Night Stand (2005)** | Successful resurrection. Original ECW talent, atmosphere, fans. Contrast with later WWECW desecration. |

### AEW WCW Elements Case Study

**Artifacts Resurrected:** 
- Sting's presentation and character
- Tony Schiavone's commentary
- Subtle WCW aesthetic elements
- Monday Night Wars nostalgia framing

**Sincerity Indicators:**
- Original talent involved (Sting, Schiavone, etc.)
- Not explicitly branded as "WCW revival"
- Organic integration, not forced
- Fan enthusiasm genuine

**Result:** 
- Disillusioned WCW fans felt acknowledged
- Nostalgia boost without exploitation accusations
- New fans introduced to WCW legacy
- Memory healing for Monday Night Wars era

| **10-20 years** | HIGH (optimal nostalgia window) | LOW |
| **20-30 years** | MEDIUM-HIGH (generational nostalgia) | LOW |
| **30+ years** | MEDIUM (diminishing living memory) | LOW |

### Generational Considerations

## 9. PHILOSOPHY

> "Artifacts carry souls. Revive them with love, and generations heal. The power isn't in the leather or the logo: it's in what they meant to people. Honor that meaning, and you can bring the dead back to life. Exploit it, and you kill it twice."

Resurrection is one of the most powerful tools for emotional repair. But it demands sincerity. Fans can tell the difference between tribute and exploitation, and they never forget which one you chose.
