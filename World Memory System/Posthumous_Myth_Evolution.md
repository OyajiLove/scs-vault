# Posthumous Myth Evolution Systems

📛 **NAME:** Posthumous Myth Evolution Systems  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** World Memory System / Legacy Dynamics  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** posthumous, myth, legacy, death, evolution, scandal, rediscovery, martyrdom, controversial  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how fallen workers' legacies evolve over generations. Authentic tributes build golden memories. Posthumous scandal discoveries cause myth decay. Rediscovery events resurrect forgotten legends. Promotions control narratives, but fan factions can splinter memories. Legacy drift rolls every 10-15 years reshape historical reputation.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 4 evolution causes (authentic tribute, posthumous scandal, rediscovery, promotion narrative control)
- 4 myth types (golden preservation, tragic martyrdom, controversial split, fade/rediscovery)
- Legacy drift rolls every 10-15 years
- Fan memory splintering creates competing narratives
- Family/survivor actions affect trajectory

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (LLM could generate evolving legacy narratives, generational debates, documentary scripts, retrospective articles)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 569-574 (locked)

## 1. MYTH EVOLUTION CAUSES (4 DRIVERS)

| Cause | Description | Direction |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Authentic Tribute Preservation** | Workers whose careers and deaths are honored sincerely see mythological prestige grow steadily over generations | POSITIVE |
| **Scandals Discovered Posthumously** | Dark truths, betrayals, or crimes surfacing after death cause myth reputation to decay sharply | NEGATIVE |
| **Rediscovery Events** | Forgotten matches, promos, feuds, personal struggles unearthed by historians trigger retroactive myth-building or myth-breaking | VARIABLE |
| **Promotion Narrative Control** | Surviving promotions shape public memory, either sanctifying the fallen figure or slowly phasing them out | VARIABLE |

---

## 2. MYTH TYPES (4 CATEGORIES)

| Type | Behavior | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Golden Memory Preservation** | Worker becomes a sacred figure in wrestling lore. Referenced in training, commentary, culture forever. | Misawa, Andre |
| **Tragic Martyrdom** | Remembered for emotional struggles. Redemption arcs posthumously woven into public memory. | Owen Hart |
| **Controversial Legacy Split** | Brilliant but problematic. Fanbases fracture over how to interpret contributions. | Chris Benoit |
| **Memory Fade and Rediscovery** | Fade for decades, then reemerge as cult heroes via documentaries, tribute shows, or nostalgic rediscovery | Various territory legends |

### Myth Type Distribution

| Worker Tier at Death | Golden | Tragic | Controversial | Fade |
|---------------------|--------|--------|---------------|------|
| **Immortal Icon** | 60% | 25% | 10% | 5% |
| **Main Eventer** | 40% | 30% | 15% | 15% |
| **Upper Midcard** | 25% | 25% | 15% | 35% |
| **Midcard/Below** | 10% | 15% | 10% | 65% |

## 3. LEGACY DRIFT ROLLS

Every generation (approximately 10-15 years), workers' historical emotional reputation shifts:

| Roll Trigger | Shift Direction |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Rediscovery Event** | +15 to +40 (positive) or -10 to -30 (if dark truths found) |
| **Scandal Exposure** | -20 to -75 depending on severity |
| **Tribute Continuation** | +5 to +15 (maintains/grows) |
| **Promotion Neglect** | -5 to -15 (fades) |
| **Cultural Mood Shift** | Variable (-20 to +20) |
| **Documentary Release** | +10 to +30 (typically positive) |

### Legacy Score Over Time

| Generation | Typical Trajectory |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Immediate (0-5 years)** | Emotional peak, raw grief, hagiography |
| **Short-term (5-15 years)** | Settling, some critical reassessment |
| **Medium-term (15-30 years)** | Crystallization, "final" reputation forming |
| **Long-term (30-50 years)** | Historical figure, subject to rediscovery |
| **Very Long-term (50+ years)** | Mythological, simplified narrative |

---

## 4. FAN MEMORY SPLINTERING

Different fan factions remember fallen workers differently:

| Faction | Memory Bias |
|---------|-------------|
| **Purist Nostalgists** | Preserve golden memory, resist criticism |
| **Workrate Technicians** | Focus on in-ring legacy, separate from personal |
| **Realism Fundamentalists** | Want full truth, resist hagiography |
| **Anarchist Loyalists** | May embrace controversial figures defiantly |
| **Irony Subverters** | Deconstruct myths, find absurdity |

### Splintering Triggers

| Trigger | Splintering Effect |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Posthumous Scandal** | Major split between defenders and condemners |
| **Promotion Exploitation** | Purists vs pragmatists |
| **Rediscovery of Flaws** | Golden memory defenders vs realists |
| **Cultural Shift** | Generational divide in interpretation |

---

## 5. FAMILY/SURVIVOR ACTIONS

Families and survivors significantly affect myth trajectory:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Active Participation in Tributes** | +20-30 legitimacy, myth strengthened |
| **Foundation/Scholarship Creation** | +25-40 long-term preservation |
| **Opposition to Exploitation** | Myth protected from corporate damage |
| **Public Criticism** | -15-30 if family disputes legacy |
| **Silence/Withdrawal** | Myth drifts without guidance |
| **Legal Action** | Variable, can protect or complicate |

### Martha Hart Case Study

**Family Action:** Refused WWE involvement in Owen's memory for 20+ years

**Effect:**
- Protected Owen from potential WWE exploitation
- Created "forbidden" mystique around Owen's legacy
- AEW partnership (2022) became major event because of rarity
- Owen's myth strengthened by scarcity of official content

**Lesson:** Family opposition can paradoxically strengthen myth by preventing overexposure.

## 6. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Worker | Posthumous Myth Evolution |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Owen Hart** | Mythological elevation via family-approved AEW tributes. Avoidance of WWE exploitation strengthens purity of memory. Tragic martyrdom type. |
| **Chris Benoit** | Controversial fracture. Brilliant career erased in many histories after double-murder suicide. Myth imploded painfully. Fan memory permanently splintered. |
| **Eddie Guerrero** | Early authentic tributes (2005-2006) strengthened myth. Later WWE overuse caused backlash fatigue in some fan factions. Trajectory: Golden → Overexposed → Settling |
| **Bruiser Brody** | Murder in Puerto Rico. Myth strengthened by injustice, tragic martyrdom combined with legendary status. |

### Eddie Guerrero Timeline

| Phase | Years | Myth Status |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Raw Grief** | 2005 | VERY HIGH (sincere tributes) |
| **Tribute Peak** | 2005-2006 | HIGH (Rey Mysterio push, memorials) |
| **Exploitation Concerns** | 2006-2007 | MEDIUM-HIGH (overuse backlash beginning) |
| **Settling** | 2008-2015 | MEDIUM-HIGH (less frequent references) |
| **Historical** | 2015+ | HIGH (time healed exploitation fatigue) |

## 7. SIMULATION MECHANICS

| Mechanic | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Legacy Drift Rolls** | Every 10-15 years, reputation shifts based on rediscovery, scandals, tribute continuation, or cultural mood |
| **Fan Memory Splintering** | Different fan factions remember fallen workers differently, causing narrative fights in public memory |
| **Promotion Policy Effects** | Promotions controlling a fallen worker's myth (using name, titles, tournaments) affect whether myth strengthens or erodes |
| **Family/Survivor Actions** | Support or opposition to memory handling impacts long-term trajectory |

## 9. PHILOSOPHY

> "Death isn't the end of loyalty — it's how survivors treat memory that keeps myths alive, mutates them, or kills them. Every generation re-judges the fallen. Every tribute either builds the legend or cheapens it. Every scandal revealed reshapes what we thought we knew. The dead don't control their legacy. The living do."

Posthumous myth evolution ensures legacy isn't static. It's contested, evolving, and emotionally meaningful across generations.
