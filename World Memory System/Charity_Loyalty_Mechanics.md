# Charity Loyalty Mechanics

📛 **NAME:** Charity Loyalty Mechanics  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** World Memory System / Solidarity Dynamics  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** charity, donation, solidarity, morality, GoFundMe, fundraiser, survivor, loyalty  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how worker-driven charity acts (donations, fundraisers, survivor support) affect loyalty, morality stats, and world memory. Public donations boost perception and fanbase loyalty. Anonymous donations improve internal respect. Organizing fundraisers creates cultural emotional resonance. These acts create generational memory inheritance: future fans remember solidarity stories.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 4 charity action types (public donations, anonymous donations, organizing fundraisers, promotion campaigns)
- Worker Morality stat adjustments from charity acts
- Worker loyalty buffs toward supportive promotions
- Fanbase emotional boosts for solidarity-practicing workers
- Generational memory inheritance (solidarity stories persist)

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Moderate (LLM could generate donation announcement narratives, solidarity stories, fan reactions to charity acts)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 565-567 (locked)

## 1. CHARITY ACTION TYPES (4 CATEGORIES)

| Action | Emotional Effect | Visibility |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Public Donations to Survivor Funds** | Boost worker public perception, backstage reputation, fanbase loyalty | HIGH |
| **Anonymous Donations** | Less world memory boost but greatly improves internal worker respect. High Morality workers prefer this. | LOW (unless revealed) |
| **Organizing Fundraisers** | Cultural emotional resonance, bonus loyalty from authenticity-aligned fanbases | HIGH |
| **Promotion-Driven Charity Campaigns** | If directed respectfully (not PR), hidden trust scores improve | MEDIUM-HIGH |

---

## 2. SIMULATION MECHANICS

| Mechanic | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Worker Morality Adjustments** | Donation and charity acts slightly raise hidden Morality stats over time |
| **Worker Loyalty Buffs** | Workers increase loyalty toward promotions that support tribute/charity events sincerely |
| **Fanbase Emotional Boosts** | Fans emotionally invest deeper into workers/promotions visibly practicing solidarity |
| **Generational Memory Inheritance** | Future fans inherit the emotional myth ("Jericho helped Garcia after crash" type stories). Minor world memory myth bonuses. |

### Morality Stat Effects

| Charity Act | Morality Boost | Frequency Limit |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Major Public Donation** | +3-5 | 2-3 per year meaningful |
| **Anonymous Donation** | +2-3 | Unlimited (if sincere) |
| **Organizing Fundraiser** | +5-8 | 1-2 per year meaningful |
| **Promotion Campaign Support** | +1-2 | Per campaign |

### Loyalty Effects

| Action | Loyalty to Promotion | Loyalty from Fans |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Public Donation** | +5 if promotion supported | +10-15 from affected fanbase |
| **Anonymous Donation** | +3 (if revealed later) | +5-10 (authenticity bonus) |
| **Organizing Fundraiser** | +10 if promotion participated | +15-25 from solidarity-fans |
| **Promotion Campaign** | +8-12 to organizing promotion | +10-20 if authentic |

## 3. GENERATIONAL MEMORY INHERITANCE

Charity acts create stories that persist across generations:

| Story Type | Persistence | Effect |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Major Public Act** | 20-50 years | Part of worker legacy, referenced in retrospectives |
| **Organizing Effort** | 30+ years | Associated with solidarity movement |
| **Consistent Pattern** | Permanent | "Known for charity" becomes core identity |
| **Single Anonymous Act** | 10-20 years if revealed | Authenticity bonus, "real one" status |

### Memory Inheritance Examples

| Original Act | Future Memory |
|--------------|---------------|
| "Jericho donated to Garcia after crash" | Future fans see Jericho as solidarity figure |
| "Dreamer organized Pillman memorials" | Dreamer = keeper of indie flame |
| "AEW Owen Hart Tournament" | AEW = authentic tribute promotion |

---

## 4. WORKER DONATION PROBABILITY

High Morality/Loyalty workers more likely to donate spontaneously:

| Trait | Base Donation Chance | Modifier |
|-------|---------------------|----------|
| **Morality 80+** | 80% | +20% for close connection |
| **Morality 60-79** | 50% | +15% for same promotion |
| **Morality 40-59** | 25% | +10% for major tragedy |
| **Morality <40** | 10% | Only for PR benefit |
| **Traditionalism 80+** | +15% | Respects "wrestling family" |
| **Financial Stress** | -40% | Can't afford it |

### Donation Triggers

| Situation | Likely Donors |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Career-Ending Injury** | Close friends, same promotion, high morality workers |
| **Medical Emergency** | Locker room leaders, financially secure veterans |
| **Family Tragedy** | Personal connections, high empathy workers |
| **Indie Worker Struggle** | Veterans who remember struggling, high traditionalism |
| **Unexpected Death** | Wide response, cross-promotional |

## 5. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Worker/Promotion | Charity Loyalty Outcome |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Chris Jericho GoFundMe Donations** | Increased emotional goodwill, brand trust across multiple fanbases. "Real one" status solidified. |
| **Bret Hart Emotional Tributes to Owen** | Massive long-term loyalty resonance. Public statements about Owen preservation became core to Bret's post-career identity. |
| **AEW Owen Hart Foundation Tournament** | AEW boosts emotional authenticity and brand loyalty by framing event as family-supported charity, not cynical PR. Model for corporate-charity balance. |
| **Tommy Dreamer Organizing Efforts** | Decades of organizing tributes, supporting struggling workers. Permanent "heart of indie wrestling" status. |

### Jericho Case Study

**Pattern:** Consistent public donations to struggling indie workers, GoFundMe contributions, vocal support.

**Effect on Jericho:**
- Morality perception: HIGH (despite heel character work)
- Solidarity credibility: VERY HIGH
- Fan loyalty: Cross-promotional respect
- Legacy association: "Helps the boys"

**Generational Inheritance:** Future fans will know Jericho as someone who supported others, regardless of his in-ring persona.

## 6. AUTHENTICITY VS PR DETECTION

Fans can detect insincere charity:

| Indicator | Sincere | PR-Driven |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Timing** | When needed | When convenient for promotion |
| **Amount** | Meaningful relative to means | Token gesture |
| **Follow-Through** | Ongoing support | One-time announcement |
| **Public Framing** | Focus on recipient | Focus on donor/promotion |
| **History** | Pattern of giving | First time, convenient |

### PR Detection Consequences

| Detection Level | Fan Response |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **Clearly Sincere** | +20-30 loyalty, +10-15 morality perception |
| **Probably Sincere** | +10-20 loyalty, +5-10 morality perception |
| **Unclear** | +5-10 loyalty, neutral morality |
| **Probably PR** | +0-5 loyalty, -5 morality perception |
| **Obviously PR** | -5-10 loyalty, -10-15 morality perception, cynicism boost |

## 8. PHILOSOPHY

> "Solidarity carves deeper scars than money. Loyalty isn't sold — it's mourned, remembered, and honored forever. The workers who give when it costs them something real, who organize when no one's watching, who remember the struggling and the fallen: they're the ones who build wrestling's soul. And fans remember. Generations remember."

Charity mechanics reveal character. They show who treats wrestling as family and who treats it as business.
