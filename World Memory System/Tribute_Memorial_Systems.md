## 3. SIMULATION MECHANICS

| Mechanic | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Automatic Tribute Generation** | When major workers or figures die unexpectedly, promotions/workers with emotional loyalty may organize tribute matches or shows dynamically |
| **Player-Driven Tributes** | Player-controlled promotions/workers can organize tributes. Sincere = emotional loyalty and brand trust increase. Exploitative = backlash. |
| **Charity Mechanic** | Revenue from tribute shows can optionally be redirected to in-world "survivor funds," boosting emotional resonance permanently |
| **Worker Voluntary Donations** | High loyalty, morality, or traditionalism workers more likely to donate spontaneously or push for memorial events without being booked |

### Automatic Tribute Triggers

| Trigger | Probability | Response Type |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Legendary Worker Death** | 95% | Major memorial show within 1 month |
| **Icon Death** | 80% | Tribute show or matches within 2 months |
| **Established Star Death** | 60% | Tribute matches at next major show |
| **Indie/Lower Card Death** | 30% | Individual worker donations, small tributes |
| **Tragic Accident (any tier)** | +25% to base | Accelerated response, cross-promotional support |

### Worker Donation Probability

| Trait | Base Donation Chance |
|-------|---------------------|
| **High Loyalty (80+)** | 70% |
| **High Morality (80+)** | 80% |
| **High Traditionalism (80+)** | 65% |
| **Personal Connection to Deceased** | +30% |
| **Same Promotion** | +20% |
| **Financial Stress** | -40% |

## 4. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Tribute Event | Emotional Impact |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Pillman Memorial Shows (1998-2001)** | Cross-promotional support, massive emotional outpouring, grassroots rebuilding of indie solidarity networks. Showed wrestling could transcend promotion wars. |
| **Bret/Benoit Owen Hart Tribute Match (WCW, 1999)** | Serious emotional catharsis match. Fans emotionally invested in sincerity, despite promotion boundaries. Proved grief transcends kayfabe. |
| **AEW Owen Hart Foundation Tournament** | Respectful, family-approved tribute building generational loyalty resonance without exploitative vibes. Model for long-term legacy preservation. |

**AEW Approach (2022+):**
- Family approval secured first
- Foundation partnership, not just branding
- Tournament format creates ongoing legacy
- Scholarship component ensures real-world impact
- Presentation respectful, not exploitative

**Result:**
- Massive fan approval
- Martha Hart's public endorsement
- Annual tradition established
- Owen's legacy preserved for new generation
- Model for sincere corporate tribute

**Key Lesson:** Family approval + ongoing commitment + real charity = successful long-term tribute.

## 6. SCANDAL EXAMPLES (WHAT NOT TO DO)

| Example | What Went Wrong | Consequence |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Eddie Guerrero Exploitation (WWE 2005-2006)** | Used Eddie's death repeatedly for storyline heat, "Eddie's in hell" angle, exploitative merchandising | Major fan backlash, damaged WWE credibility with Latino audience |
| **Benoit Memory Erasure** | Complete removal vs acknowledgment of complicated legacy | Ongoing fan debate, no closure |
| **Rushed Tribute Shows** | Events planned before proper mourning | Feels performative, not sincere |

### Eddie Guerrero Case Study

**Initial Tribute:** Sincere memorial show, emotional promos, genuine grief. Positive response.

**Exploitation Phase:**
- "I'm doing this for Eddie" became storyline crutch
- Rey Mysterio pushed using Eddie's memory repeatedly
- "Eddie's in hell" Randy Orton promo
- Excessive merchandise

**Fan Response:**
- Initial goodwill eroded
- Latino fans particularly offended
- Long-term trust damage
- Became canonical example of exploitation

**Lesson:** Initial tribute can be sincere. Problem is prolonged exploitation. There's a line between honoring and using.

## 10. PHILOSOPHY

> "Workers don't just build legacy through championships: they build it through how they're remembered and how they remember others. Promotions show their real soul not in booking alone, but in how they honor the fallen. This is where wrestling's emotional bloodstream comes alive: loss, loyalty, gratitude, grief, pride, guilt, forgiveness."

Tribute systems reveal character. They show whether wrestling is a family or just a business. The difference between exploitation and honor defines a promotion's soul.
