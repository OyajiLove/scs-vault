## Overview

Memory isn't global unless the moment is legendary. Each region tracks its own memories.

---

## Regional Memory Tracking

Each region maintains:

| Tracked Element | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|
| **Snapshot moments** | What happened here matters most |
| **Title reign prestige** | Local champs remembered longer |
| **Feud legacies** | Regional rivalries persist |
| **Workers most beloved** | Hometown heroes |
| **Workers most resented** | Those who wronged the region |

---

## Regional Memory Strength

| Context | Memory Behavior |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Home region** | Strongest, slowest decay |
| **Adjacent regions** | Moderate, normal decay |
| **Distant regions** | Weak unless globally significant |
| **International** | Requires major crossover |

## Regional Bias Examples

> "He never made it big, but in Cork... they still chant his name."

> "She was world champion, but Osaka never forgave her for that match."

> "The Northeast remembers that title run. The rest of the country forgot."

## Territory Memory

Promotions with strong regional roots hold onto local myth longer:

| Territory Type | Memory Behavior |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Memphis** | Deep historical memory, loyalty-based |
| **Osaka/Kanto** | Style-specific recall |
| **Philly/ECW region** | Cult memory, workrate-focused |
| **CDMX/Lucha zones** | Family lineage memory |

## Cross-Regional Memory Spread

| Event Type | Spread Behavior |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Local TV match** | Stays regional |
| **PPV/major show** | Spreads to promotion's reach |
| **Viral moment** | Can spread globally (modern era) |
| **International tour** | Creates memory in visited region |
