# FEUD MEMORY TRACKER

📛 **NAME:** Feud Memory Tracker (Booking Engine Phase 3.1)  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Storyline Tracking, Rivalry History & Emotional Investment  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** feuds, rivalry, match history, emotional peaks, feud fatigue, payoff timing, callbacks  
📝 **SUMMARY:**

Tracks long-term feud arcs between workers, measuring emotional heat, crowd investment, and optimal payoff timing. Prevents feud fatigue from overexposure and enables powerful callbacks years later. System monitors match history, betrayals, title changes, and key moments to build feud depth that affects crowd reactions.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Tracks all significant interactions between workers (matches, segments, betrayals, injuries)
- Measures crowd investment level: how much fans care about this specific rivalry
- Feud fatigue builds when same match-up overexposed without progression
- Memory decay varies: high-emotion feuds remembered longer, low-stakes feuds fade fast
- Suggests optimal payoff timing (when to blow off feud before crowd bored)
- Enables callback opportunities (reuniting dormant feuds generates nostalgia pop)
- Different feud types have different optimal durations and intensities

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes: suggests feud progression beats, identifies callback opportunities, warns of fatigue risk, generates storyline continuation ideas

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol. 2 (Booking Engine Phase 3), locked alongside Turn Engine and Predictability & Stakes Logic

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** [[Booking_Engine_P1-3]], [[Crowd_Memory]], [[Turn_Engine]], [[Predictability_Stakes]], Match Engine, [[Emotional_Show_Flow]], [[Living_Feud_Memory_System]]

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**

- Exact formulas for feud fatigue accumulation
- How do multi-person feuds track differently than singles feuds?
- Can feuds be "archived" and later "reactivated" with different mechanics?

✅ **STATUS:** LOCKED (Vol 2, Phase 3)

## FEUD TYPES & DURATIONS

| Feud Type | Optimal Duration | Intensity | Payoff Event | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Blood Feud** | 6-12 months | Maximum | Career-defining match (cage, retirement, loser leaves) | Personal hatred, violence escalation |
| **Title Chase** | 3-6 months | High | Championship win/loss | Must culminate in title change or definitive end |

| **One-Off** | Single show | Low | That night's match | No story, pure match quality |

## TRACKING METRICS

### Match History

- Total matches between workers
- Win/loss record
- Match quality average
- Stipulation matches (hardcore, cage, etc.)
- Title matches

### Emotional Peaks

- Betrayals (turn moments)
- Injuries (real or angle)
- Title changes
- Screwjobs/controversies
- Blood/violence escalation
- Personal attacks (family, character)

### Crowd Investment Score (0-100)

- Based on: crowd reactions, segment heat, merchandise sales, social media buzz
- **High Investment (80-100):** Crowd deeply cares, can't miss TV
- **Medium Investment (50-79):** Crowd interested, solid reactions
- **Low Investment (20-49):** Crowd lukewarm, filler feud
- **Dead (0-19):** Crowd doesn't care, change direction

### Feud Fatigue Meter (0-100)

- **Low Fatigue (0-30):** Feud feels fresh, can continue
- **Medium Fatigue (31-60):** Need progression or cool-down
- **High Fatigue (61-85):** Must blow off soon or crowd turns
- **Critical Fatigue (86-100):** Crowd actively rejecting feud, emergency pivot needed

---

## FEUD PROGRESSION BEATS

### Typical Blood Feud Arc (6-12 months):

**Month 1-2: Setup**

- Inciting incident (betrayal, attack, disrespect)
- First confrontation (promo, pull-apart brawl)
- Initial match (heel wins dirty or interference)

**Month 3-4: Escalation**

- Rematch (babyface wins or screwed again)
- Personal attacks escalate (family, character)
- Stipulation announced (cage, no DQ, etc.)

**Month 5-6: Peak**

- Blow-off match at major show
- Definitive winner
- Feud ends (or... swerve betrayal starts new arc)

**Variation: Extended Blood Feud (7-12 months)**

- Add: Injury angle (kayfabe or shoot)
- Add: Third-party interference (manager, faction)
- Add: False finish (screwjob extends feud)
- Peak: Ultra-violent blow-off (Hell in Cell, exploding ring, etc.)

---

## FEUD FATIGUE MECHANICS

### Fatigue Builds When:

- Same match repeated without variation (3+ times)
- No storyline progression between matches
- Predictable outcomes (babyface always screwed)
- Overexposure (every show, multiple segments)
- Lack of escalation (no stakes increase)

### Fatigue Reduces When:

- Time apart (cool-down period)
- Fresh stipulation added
- Third party adds new dynamic
- Character development/turn
- Storyline twist (betrayal, alliance, reveal)

### Critical Threshold:

**If Fatigue ≥ 80 and Investment < 50:**

- Crowd actively wants feud to end
- Segments get "boring" chants
- Match ratings suffer despite quality
- **Action Required:** Blow off immediately or pivot completely

## CALLBACK SYSTEM

### Dormant Feud Reactivation

**When Feud Has Been Dormant 1+ Years:**

- Memory decay has occurred
- Nostalgia factor builds
- **Callback Pop:** Returns can generate huge reaction

**Example Progression:**

1. **Active Feud (2023):** Investment 90, Fatigue 75 → Blow off at PPV
2. **Dormancy (2024-2026):** Memory decays to 60, Fatigue resets to 0
3. **Surprise Return (2027):** Nostalgia pop +30, Investment spikes to 85
4. **Quick Program (1-2 months):** One more match, then done for good

### Callback Opportunities:

- Anniversary shows (WrestleMania rematch 10 years later)
- Retirement tours (one last match with old rival)
- Hall of Fame inductions (reconciliation angle)
- Surprise returns (attacking old enemy)
- Tag team reunion (former rivals team up)

---

## MULTI-PERSON FEUDS

### Three-Way Feuds

- Tracks relationships between all three workers
- Can have: A hates B, B hates C, C neutral to A
- Payoff: Triple Threat or elimination-style match
- **Risk:** Confusing if not clearly defined

### Faction Wars

- Tracks: Faction A vs. Faction B
- Individual match-ups within larger war
- Can have: Betrayals, defections, leadership changes
- Payoff: War Games, Survivor Series, Faction disbands
- **Risk:** Too many people dilutes individual stories

---

## MEMORY ANCHORS FROM FEUDS

### High-Memory Feud Moments:

- **Betrayal Turn:** Austin/McMahon, Mega Powers explode
- **Career-Ending Match:** HBK/Flair, Undertaker/HBK
- **Blood Bath:** Cactus/Triple H, Bret/Austin
- **Title Change:** Hogan/Andre, Bryan/Cena
- **Screwjob:** Montreal, Fingerpoke of Doom

These become **Anchors** (memory markers) that:

- Generate commentary callbacks forever
- Affect future storylines (grudge never forgotten)
- Elevate worker legacies
- Can be referenced in other feuds

## CALLBACK EFFECTIVENESS DECAY (#185)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #185

### References to Past Feuds/Moments Lose Power Over Time

| Time Since Event | Callback Power |
|------------------|----------------|
| **1-3 months** | Full emotional impact |
| **6-12 months** | Moderate impact, hardcore fans respond |
| **1-3 years** | Nostalgic pop, new fans confused |
| **5+ years** | Only works for legendary moments |

**Exception:** Truly legendary moments (Hogan/Andre, Austin 3:16, Montreal Screwjob) retain power indefinitely.

## FEUD HEAT DECAY (#201)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #201

### How Feud Intensity Changes Over Time

| Status | Heat Level |
|--------|------------|
| **Active (matches scheduled)** | Peak heat maintained |
| **Dormant (no interaction)** | Decays 10% per month |
| **Referenced (promos only)** | Decays 5% per month |
| **Revived (new incident)** | Can restore to 80% of peak |

**Application:** Long-running feuds need periodic fuel to stay hot. Scheduled matches, promos, or incidents prevent decay.

**Document Status:** Locked (Vol 2, Phase 3)
