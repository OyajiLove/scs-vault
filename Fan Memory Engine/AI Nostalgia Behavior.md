## Nostalgia Push Triggers

|-----------|--------|
| **[[Memory Snapshots|Snapshot moment]] lives on** | Worker remains bookable |
| **Worker is legacy figure** | Nostalgia potential detected |
| **Fanbase sentiment remains** | Crowd still responds |
| **Current push fading** | Booker looks for alternatives |
| **Retirement/anniversary/loss** | Opportunity window |

## Booker Personality Responses

| Booker Type | Nostalgia Response |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Chaos Artist** | May mock or subvert legacy, turn old stars heel |
| **Traditionalist** | Honors memory deeply; uses legends to reset order |
| **Star Maker** | Uses nostalgia to crown someone new (passing torch) |
| **Realist** | Will re-push if crowd still cares; tests the waters |
| **Heart-Driven** | Books emotionally: loyalty arcs, tribute matches, closure |
| **Heat Merchant** | Leverages old memory for betrayal, heat, or humiliation |
| **Experimentalist** | Subverts memory: ironic returns, alternate personas |
| **Fixer** | Uses nostalgia when ratings slip; safe pop grab |

## Nostalgia Push Forms

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Redemption Arc** | "I never got my due." Booker uses memory to right a past wrong. |
| **Legacy Rivalry Callback** | "We never finished this." Feud from 5-10 years ago reignited. |
| **Anniversary Special** | Tribute match, return match, memorial show. |
| **Commentary-Cued Revival** | Memory referenced heavily to rebuild pop. |
| **HOF / Retirement Setup** | Final run angle based on memory + emotion. |
| **Ghost Feud** | Worker feuds with someone tied to their past rival. |

## Memory-Driven Push Mechanics

1. AI checks current [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz]] and [[Popularity_System|Pop]]
2. If low, checks [[Memory Snapshots|Memory Snapshot]] strength
3. If memory strong, books nostalgia segment to test
4. Fan response loop begins
5. If hits: momentum builds, push continues
6. If flops: push ends gently, memory may decay further

## Morale & Political Effects (Vol 6)

| Context | Reaction |
|---------|----------|
| 📉 Worker thought they were done | Morale boost if push reignites career |
| 👥 Others feel overlooked | Locker room tension, "He's washed!" pushback |
| 🤝 Former rival still active | May cause resistance, creative tension, promo heat |
| 🏛 Promotion has rich memory culture | Fans may demand nostalgia push, even if booker is skeptical |

## Real-World Parallels

| Example | Memory Used |
