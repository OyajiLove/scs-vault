## Memory-Driven Push Mechanics

1. AI checks current [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz]] and [[Popularity_System|Pop]]
2. If low, checks [[Memory Snapshots|Memory Snapshot]] strength
3. If memory strong, books nostalgia segment to test
4. Fan response loop begins
5. If hits: momentum builds, push continues
6. If flops: push ends gently, memory may decay further
