# Fan Memory Engine

📛 **SYSTEM:** Fan Memory Engine
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Crowd Psychology / Long-Term Tracking
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** fan memory, snapshots, decay, misremembering, nostalgia, reactivation
📝 **SUMMARY:** Tracks what fans remember about workers, feuds, and moments over time. Memories decay, can be misremembered, and get reactivated by callbacks. Different fan types and regions have different memory characteristics.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- High-emotion events create "Memory Snapshots" (permanent or decaying)
- Memories affect crowd reactions to returns, callbacks, and story beats
- Memory decays over time but can be reactivated by similar events
- Fans can "misremember" (combining events, exaggerating, forgetting context)
- Different fan types (casual, hardcore, lapsed) have different memory profiles
- Regional variation in what gets remembered

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes. LLM can generate nostalgia-based commentary, suggest callback opportunities, and frame "misremembered" narratives.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5-6 (developed across both)

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Memory capacity limits (how many active memories per worker?)
- Cross-generational memory transfer mechanics
- Social media era memory amplification
