## Overview

> "When the audience speaks, the booking either listens... or pays the price."

Simulates crowd language, emotion spikes, and audience rituals that reflect not just response volume, but emotional meaning. This isn't just "pop" or "heat." It's ritual, rejection, acceptance, grief, and longing.

## Signal Types

| Signal Type | Description | Triggers |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Unprompted Chant | Fans begin chant with no prompt | Memory spike, organic moment |
| Ritual Chant | Recurring chant tied to worker or catchphrase | Legacy anchor, cultural connection |
| Honor Clap | Japanese-style measured applause | Respect moment, near-falls |
| Silent Reverence | No noise, on purpose | Retirement, mask handoffs, grief |
| Emotional Break | Visible tears, crowd sobbing, gasps | Death angles, farewell losses |
| Angry Chant | "Sellout," "You Screwed X," "We Want Y" | Bad heel turn, booking betrayal |
| Reclaim Chant | Fans chanting for retired name/gimmick | Pushback against reboot, forced change |
| Thank You [Name] | Universal tribute call | Retirement, HOF, death shows |
| This Is Awesome | High-buzz peak moment chant | Region-locked: mostly Western fans |

---

## Crowd Signal Engine

At any moment (especially ceremonies), the engine checks:

| Variable | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Fan Type Distribution | Hardcore, Traditionalist, Casual, Troll |
| Region Style | Japan = claps/silence; US = chants/heckles |
| Booking Memory | Has this angle been earned emotionally? |
| Gimmick State | Iconic Lock, Immortal Status, Gimmick Death? |
| Snapshot Activation | Is this closing a memory arc? |
| Legacy Score | 60+ = likely gratitude; 85+ = ritual chants almost guaranteed |
| Worker Popularity | Must match tone (fake tears for cold worker = rejection) |

---

## Ceremony-Specific Responses

| Segment Type | Crowd Signal |
|--------------|--------------|
| Mask Retirement | "Thank you [Name]," silence during handoff, then eruption |
| Final Match | Standing ovation on entrance/exit, "You Still Got It" if performance lands |
| Title Surrender | Mixed chant + quiet acceptance or gasps (depends on age/health/booking memory) |
| Gimmick Death | Booed if unearned; chanted for if earned; "One More Time" if crowd disagrees |
| Posthumous Tribute | Standing silence, then ritual chant or funeral salute (10-bell, flowers, mask left in ring) |

---

## Chant Memory

Chants can be stored and recalled:

| Type | Example | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| Stored Per Worker | "Thank You Liger" | Auto-triggered by AI if conditions match |
| Region Locked | "This is awesome" | Not used in Mexico/Japan unless crowd style changes |
| Reclaimed Over Time | "Let's Go X" | May return years after last appearance |
| Weaponized by Crowd | "We Want [Other Worker]" | During someone else's push segment |

Bookers who ignore chant data risk crowd rejection.

## Historical Cases

| Event | Chant/Signal | Meaning |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Flair WrestleMania 24 | "Thank You Ric" + crowd tears | Full-circle arc embraced |
| Tanahashi post-G1 2018 | Silent audience, one fan weeping | Poetic emotion without chants |
| Hogan Bash at the Beach '96 | Loud pop → angry chants post-turn | Fan betrayal + shock ripple |
| Muta's Final Match | Ritual chants, mist salute, silent awe | Cultural closure and gratitude |
| ROH Danielson Farewell | "Please Don't Go" → "You Deserve It" | Grieving and honoring simultaneously |

---

## System Integration

| System | Uses Crowd Signals |
|--------|-------------------|
| Booking Engine | Chants can override AI decisions, cause rebooked pushes or trail pivots |
| Fan Memory Engine | Unique chants tied to segments = instant memory snapshots |
| Legacy Tracker | Final pop/chant strength contributes to Legacy rise on retirement |
| Push Resistance | Crowds chanting for others during segments = push conflict trigger |
| Promo System | Workers can reference crowd behavior directly ("You turned your backs on me") |

## Chants in Match Summaries

Chants serve as emotional metadata in match write-ups:

### 1. Narrative Echoes
Chants appear directly in summaries:
> "The crowd roared as Santo fought off the third near-fall, with chants of '¡Santo! ¡Santo!' building to a fever pitch."

### 2. Performance Feedback

| Booking Outcome | Chant Signal | Interpretation |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Standard win | No chants | Crowd passive |
| Cold match | "We Want [Other Worker]" | Push resistance |
| Banger match | "This Is Awesome" | Buzz spike pending |
| Near-turn segment | "One More Time" | Fan wants betrayal/return |
| Ceremony | "Thank You [Name]" | Memory snapshot likely |

### 3. Angle & Feud Momentum Cues
Track whether arc is peaking, turn is earned, or time to pivot.

### 4. Fan Memory Triggers
Emotionally charged chants tied to high-Buzz/Legacy workers may permanently mark the moment.

### 5. Booking Decision Influence
Ignoring "We Want X" too long triggers Push Conflict or crowd backlash.

### 6. Flavor + Identity

| Region/Style | Chant Profile |
|--------------|---------------|
| Mexico (lucha) | Call-and-response, hero reverence, regional chants |
| Japan (puro) | Honor claps, rare "name" calls, silent awe |
| US indie | "This is awesome," ironic heel chants, F-bombs |
| Southern US | "Kick his ass," "He sold out," religious callbacks |
| Joshi-specific | "Ganbare," full-name chants, crying children |
