## Chant Profile Matrix

### US/Canada

| Era | Chant Style | Personality |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| 1980s | Loud boo/cheer waves, name chants ("Hogan! Hogan!") | Unironic, tribal, patriotic |
| 1990s | "You screwed Bret," "ECW," anti-heel eruptions | Emotional, grudge-driven, angle-attached |
| 2000s | "Let's go Cena / Cena sucks," "This is awesome" emerges | Split loyalty, crowd identity rising |
| 2010s–Now | "You deserve it," ironic chants, troll noise | Hyper-aware, attention-seeking, performance-judging |

### Japan

| Era | Chant Style | Personality |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| 1980s–2000s | Silence, isolated first-name chants, claps | Deep respect, only major stars get chants |
| 2010s–Now | Slight increase in callouts (Tanahashi, Ibushi) | Still restrained, rarely sarcastic |

### Other Regions

| Region | Era | Chant Style | Personality |
|--------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| Mexico | Any | Chant duels, "Santo! Santo!", region-based calls | Passionate, familial, tradition-rooted |
| UK/Europe | 2010s–Now | Football-style chants, singalongs | Communal, cheeky, genre-aware |
| Joshi Puro | 1980s–Now | Full-name chants, crying kids, ritual applause | Fierce loyalty, rarely ironic, emotional edge |
| Territory (US) | 1970s–80s | "Kick his ass," "Don't take no shit" | Bluster, aggression, working-class catharsis |

## Simulation Rules

### 1. Region + Era Gate Chant Pools
- Each combo has specific chant types available
- Crowd segments seeded with Fan Culture Profiles
- Engine uses Booking Memory + Emotional Tags + Worker Pop/Buzz to determine triggers

### 2. Tone Enforcement

| Tone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Earnest | Loyal, direct, not mocking ("We love you!") |
| Tribal | Based on identity, face/heel allegiance ("USA!") |
| Ironic | Modern smark behavior, booing the good guy, chanting for nonsense |
| Ritualized | Puro/lucha/joshi stylized respect behaviors |
| Mocking | "What?" chants, derailing promos (era-locked to 2000s–present US/UK) |

### 3. Commentary Response Layer
Commentary interprets crowd behavior through Cultural Lens:
- 1980s US: "This crowd is electric — they want blood!"
- 1990s Japan: "Listen to that silence… they're hanging on every hold."
- 2020s UK: "These fans are singing his name louder than his music!"

## Locked Design Consequences

- "This is awesome" won't happen in 80s Crockett or 90s AJPW, ever
- Modern-day lucha crowds may chant "rudo" but not do ironic pop-fests
- Joshi match at Korakuen = full-name chant or total silence (unless legacy involved)
- Modern US show = 50/50 crowds, "You deserve it," "Fight forever," "We want [someone else]"
