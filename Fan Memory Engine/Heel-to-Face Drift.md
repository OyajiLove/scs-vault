## Overview

> "You booked them to be scum. But they hit that one promo... and now the crowd wants to believe in them."

Even if booking stays heel and promos stay venomous, the crowd may start turning a character face on their own, with or without consent. The sim tracks where the heat comes from, and when it stops feeling like hate.

## Drift Detection Triggers

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Promo Sympathy Moment | Heel gives hint of trauma, truth, or pain (crowd connects emotionally) |
| Workrate Respect Spike | Banger match → "You still got it," "That was awesome" chants begin |
| Catchphrase Infection | Fans adopt and repeat heel's insults or mannerisms with joy |
| Babyface Shortage | Fans latch onto heel because no viable faces to cheer |
| Hero Targeting Fatigue | Crowd turns when heel keeps burying beloved workers without payoff |
| Legacy Memory Activation | Heel reminds fans of respected older version of themselves |
| Push Resistance Flip | Face is too corporate or weak → heel becomes "realer" by contrast |

## Drift Phases

| Phase | Description | Crowd Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 🧊 Denial | Booker insists heel is hated | Booed, but name chanted between matches |
| 🔄 Confusion | Crowd splits based on region/fan type | "Let's go X / X sucks" |
| 🔥 Acceptance | Heel starts getting full cheers in hot markets | Buzz spikes, chants trigger |
| 🎭 Reframing | Commentary starts softening language | "Love him or hate him…" |
| 🧨 Full Flip | AI/Player books double turn or face promo arc | New gimmick loaded or old one redeemed |

## Drift Rate Modifiers

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Era + Region | Modern US/UK: Drift likely. 80s NWA? Less so. |
| Fan Culture Index | Smark-heavy crowds flip faster. Traditionalist bases resist. |
| AI Booker Personality | Chaos or Smark bookers embrace it. Traditionalists resist and bury. |
| Worker Morality / Drive | High Morality = easier emotional flip. High Ego = may resist. |
| Buzz vs Pop Gap | If Buzz high but Pop falling (or vice versa), Drift risk rises. |
| Recent Snapshots | If Memory Moment landed emotionally, fans may reframe character completely. |

## Drift Response Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Lean Into It | Shift promos, tweak segments, slow-burn turn begins |
| Snap Turn | Face promo, big save, or double turn at PPV |
| Double Down on Heat | Heel goes nuclear (attacks fan fave in home city, buries legacy) |
| Ignore Crowd | Push resistance risk grows, chants escalate, segments derail |
| Promo Gaslight | Heel claims they're still hated even as cheers ring out (prolongs ambiguity) |

## System Interactions

| System | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Gimmick System | May trigger gimmick evolution (not full change) |
| Fan Memory | Drift-triggered segments often generate snapshot moments |
| Push Resistance | Drifted heels stealing crowd support may cause face resentment backstage |
| Commentary Engine | Switches tone: "This isn't the man we saw a year ago…" |
| Booking Trails | Drift may fracture existing Trail → starts new Redemption or Reframing Arc |

## Real-World Parallels

| Worker | Drift Example |
|--------|---------------|
| MJF (pre-2023) | Smark crowds started cheering out of respect for mic skill and authenticity |
| Roman Reigns (2015–20) | Failed face drift due to rejection, reversed in Bloodline era |
| Kevin Owens (2014+) | Booked heel, turned by audience investment during emotional segments |
| LA Knight (2023) | Ironic cheers became genuine support, forced face positioning mid-push |
| Becky Lynch (2018) | Booked heel post-SummerSlam → crowd turned her into The Man overnight |
| Steve Austin (1996–97) | Heel Drift turned him into anti-hero, not a booking decision at first |

> "You can no longer 'just book heat.' If the fans feel something — they'll start pulling your story off the rails."
