## Version History

| Version | Source | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1.0 | Vol 5-6 | 🔒 LOCKED |

---

## Overview

Fans don't remember what happened. They remember what they felt, twisted through time and tribalism.

---

## Misremembering Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Reverse Outcome** | Fans recall loser as winner | "Didn't she tap her out that night?" (She didn't) |
| **Emotional Inversion** | Heel betrayal remembered as justified | "He turned because they never respected him." (They did) |
| **Spectacle Distortion** | Entrance becomes the memory, not the match | Onita at the Dome remembered for the cigarette |
| **Downplay Syndrome** | Fans downplay old feuds to justify new stars | "That run wasn't all that..." (It was) |
| **Mythmaking** | Regular match becomes "one of the greats" | "That was the moment wrestling changed." (It wasn't, until now) |

## Why Misremembering Happens

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Time** | Details blur, emotional core remains |
| **Fan allegiance** | Reframe to support current favorites |
| **Commentary rewriting** | Announcers reshape narratives |
| **Promo references** | Workers lie about history |
| **Cultural shifts** | What was heel becomes face in retrospect |

---

## Gameplay Effects

| Effect | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| **Legacy pushes based on misremembered moments** | Backlash risk if reality surfaces |
| **Promo fuel** | Workers can lie about history, fans may believe |
| **Fan loyalty conflicts** | Old vs young fans argue over "what really happened" |
| **HOF voting affected** | Voters remember their version |
| **AI booking strategy** | Feeds myths, may create false nostalgia |
| **Faction wars** | Different camps claim different histories |

---

## Distortion Triggers

| Trigger | Likely Distortion |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Worker decline** | Peak remembered as bigger |
| **Worker scandal** | Peak minimized or erased |
| **Generational shift** | New fans adopt simplified versions |
| **Documentary release** | Can correct or amplify distortions |

---

## Commentary Behavior (Vol 6)

AI-controlled commentary will:
- **Reinforce or distort** memory based on Booker Philosophy
- Use **Myth Language**: "That night in Tokyo when time stood still..."
- Sometimes **contradict fans**: "People say she never tapped, but we have the footage."

This builds generational and narrative friction over time.

---

## Summary (Canon)

Fan memories:
- Fade unevenly
- Warp with time, ego, culture, and narrative retelling
- Become emotional tools more than factual records

SCS will simulate not just what happened... but what people **remember** happening.

> And that, tovarisch, is the root of all great wrestling drama.
