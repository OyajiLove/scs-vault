Not everyone remembers the same thing the same way. Fan types have distinct memory patterns.

## Fan Type Memory Styles

| Fan Type | Memory Style | What They Remember |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Hardcore Fans** | Deep recall, emotional weight, legacy-rich | Everything, with context |
| **Casual Fans** | Memory fades fast; follow trends, not arcs | Big moments only |
| **Cultural Loyalists** | Region-first memories | "Homegrown hero" bias |
| **Workrate Heads** | Remember bangers, forget promos | Match quality, move sequences |
| **Promo Junkies** | Remember segments, viral shoots | Pipebombs, catchphrases |
| **Trolls & Contrarians** | Misremember on purpose | Ironic chants, revisionism |
