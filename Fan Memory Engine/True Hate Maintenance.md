## Tools for Maintaining True Hate

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| "No Merch" Clause | AI/booker refuses to release heel merch (resists cool-factor drift) |
| Scorned Segment Tone | Segments scripted as cruel, uncomfortable, not performative |
| Target Beloved Workers | Heel insults/attacks cultural icons (Immortals, Legends, Young Aces) |
| Cheap Heat Flags | City insults, kid bullying, off-limits mic work (crowd hates it, not enjoys it) |
| Stifled Finish Booking | Heels win via groan-worthy tactics, not cleverness |
| Isolation Protocol | Deny heel "tag in" to hot feuds, keep them in miserable heel vortex |

## Calibration Examples

| Heel | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Roman (2015–20) | Unintended heel due to push rejection, no hate, no heat at times |
| MJF (early AEW) | Drew ironic love due to mic skill and meta-awareness ("cool heel" risk) |
| Baron Corbin | Genuine hate (2019–21) due to presentation, booking, lack of irony |
| Jay White | Booed for match pacing + cold presence, not cool ("true hate") |
| Don Callis | Excellent at remaining hated by presenting no emotional reward |
| Taichi (pre-2019) | Booed because fans legitimately wanted him off the card (later transitioned to ironic love) |
