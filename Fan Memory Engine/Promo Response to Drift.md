## Overview

> "The crowd's voice is no longer background. It's a narrative actor — and the worker must answer."

How drifted heels react to the crowd trying to redeem them in segment summaries, promo logic, and gimmick adaptation.

## Promo Response Types

| Response Type | Description | Drift Outcome |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Acknowledge Softly | Accepts fan reaction without pandering | Begins slow-burn face turn |
| Direct Reversal | Openly thanks fans, turns face in promo | Full turn locked in |
| Deflect/Mock | Calls fans fickle, untrustworthy | Extends ambiguity, crowd heat grows |
| Gaslight | Claims fans are still booing even as they cheer | Creates heat paradox, can hold heel status if committed |
| Weaponize Drift | Blames face workers for "stealing attention," fans for being "idiots" | Heel doubles down, nuclear heat segment |
| Split Crowd Lean | Uses dueling chants to cut promos tailored to both halves | Creates modern anti-hero dynamic (Cena, MJF) |

## Promo Tone Flags

| Tone Flag | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Vulnerable | Increases emotional resonance, Buzz spike likely |
| Cold / Detached | Delays drift, fans project mystery onto worker |
| Mocking | Generates polarizing crowd split |
| Gratitude | Auto-triggers Memory Snapshot if combined with farewell, title win, or save |
| Denial | Risky: if crowd doesn't buy it, segment flops or turns ironic |
| Breaking Character | "Real name" drop, shoot-style, may trigger Myth-Making if emotionally lands |

These tones shape how segment text appears in summaries and how fans remember it.

## Control Systems

| Control Point | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| Promo Editor UI | Player selects response type, tone flag, and callouts (rival, crowd, past) |
| AI Decision Tree | Uses Booker Philosophy + Fan Heat Analysis + Worker Tags (Drive, Morality, Paranoia) |
| Promo Memory Link | If previous promo started drift, current one references it (emotional continuity) |

## Segment Summary Examples

**Acknowledge Softly:**
> "As the cheers rolled in, Devlin looked confused. Then? Grateful. 'I didn't think I needed you. I was wrong.'"

**Deflect/Mock + Gaslight:**
> "They chanted his name, and he sneered. 'That's rich. Six months ago, you begged for my head. Keep your cheers. You don't deserve me.'"

**Direct Reversal:**
> "'I hear you. I hear every damn one of you. And maybe… just maybe… I'll fight for you this time.'"

## Booking Trail Hooks

| Response Type | Trail Effect |
|---------------|--------------|
| Acknowledge | Auto-generates Redemption Arc Trail seed |
| Deflect | Sets up Fan Conflict Trail (fans vs heel) |
| Split Crowd | Creates Moral Ambiguity trail (alignment remains unclear) |
| Mocking Turn | If combined with betrayal, starts Double Turn sequence |
| Silent Response | No promo, just facial/body language: commentary interprets, fans speculate, mystery spike |
