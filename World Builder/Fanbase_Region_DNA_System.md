# Fanbase/Region DNA System

📛 **NAME:** Fanbase/Region DNA System
🧭 **CATEGORY:** World Builder / Fan Behavior
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** demographics, regional identity, fan values, scandal sensitivity, cultural DNA, population profiles
📝 **SUMMARY:** Every region and promotion has a living Fanbase DNA Profile comprising demographic, cultural, emotional, and historical traits. This DNA shapes what fans want, how they react to booking, scandals, and gimmicks, and how loyalty evolves over time.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Regions have Population DNA (general cultural baseline)
- Promotions have Fanbase DNA (specific slice attracted to their identity)
- Promotions recruit from surrounding population
- Alignment with population = easy growth; clash = cult loyalty or collapse
- DNA evolves decade by decade, can mutate through booking/branding
- Scandals, booking choices, and world events all affect DNA shifts

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (lookup and comparison system)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 2 Chunk 08

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Scandal System]] (reaction severity)
- [[Regional Gimmick Reception]] (face/heel by location)
- [[Language Compatibility]] (promo effectiveness)
- [[Global Event Stream]] (cultural shifts)
- [[Booking System]] (fan reaction calculation)

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- How granular should region breakdown be? (State vs Prefecture vs City vs Rural/Urban)
- Exact weight values for demographic factors in calculations
- How fast should DNA shift in response to events?

✅ **STATUS:** Locked

## Regional Hierarchy

```
World Map
    ↓
Region (North America, Asia, Europe, etc.)
    ↓
Nation (United States, Japan, Mexico, etc.)
    ↓
State/Prefecture/Province (Texas, Tokyo, Ontario, etc.)
    ↓
Urban/Rural Identity (Dallas vs West Texas, Tokyo Metro vs Rural Kanto)
    ↓
Population DNA (Cultural, Demographic, Emotional DNA)
```

Promotions "recruit" fans locally first, then expand outward if culturally compatible.

| Late 90s | Extreme kayfabe loyalty crash; fans jaded; cult worship grows |
| 2000s | Divided: casuals vs workrate nerds |
| 2010s | Rising progressive fanbases, scandal sensitivity grows, nostalgia revival |
| 2020s | Full fragmentation: casual sports entertainment, hardcore indie loyalists, progressive activists, nostalgic oldheads coexist uneasily |

## Promotion vs Population DNA Interaction

### Recruitment Strength

```
Does Promotion DNA Align With Population?
    → Yes → Rapid growth, mainstream acceptance
    → No → Slow niche growth, possible cult loyalty, or stagnation
```

### Cultural Clash

- **Alignment:** Easy growth, mainstream acceptance
- **Smart Clash:** (ECW vs 90s moral panic) Builds cult loyalty
- **Stupid Clash:** (PG WWE trying Attitude revival in 2020s) Collapse or flailing

### Mutation Events

| Event | Mutation Effect |
|-------|-----------------|
| Major Scandal Mishandled | Fanbase fragments, becomes more niche |
| New Star With Different Appeal | Fanbase shifts toward new demographic |
| Regional/Era Shift | Promotions must adapt or fade |
| Booking Style Changes | DNA realigns or alienates old loyalists |
