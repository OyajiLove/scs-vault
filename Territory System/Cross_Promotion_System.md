# SCS_BIBLE_13_CROSS_PROMOTION_SYSTEM.md

📛 **NAME:** Cross-Promotion Relationship Lifecycle System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** World Systems / Inter-Promotion Dynamics  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** cross-promotion, talent exchange, territory raids, invasions, partnerships, co-promotion, poaching, betrayal, booking politics  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Comprehensive system governing how promotions interact through talent exchanges, partnerships, raids, and invasions. Includes promotion personality traits that influence negotiation behavior, worker post-loss demand systems, and fanbase loyalty mechanics that differ by region. Distinguishes between predatory raids, cooperative invasions, and mutual partnerships.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Promotions have Exchange Priority Traits that influence how they approach talent sharing
- Talent movement types: Natural Migration, Predatory Raiding, Rescue/Acquisition
- Relationship lifecycle: Initiation → Active → Tension → Conflict/Collapse → Legacy
- Workers can demand compensation/booking after cross-promotion losses
- Division bookers can have different philosophies than head bookers
- Japanese vs Western fanbase loyalty patterns affect cross-promotion dynamics

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (core logic deterministic; LLM could generate negotiation dialogue or backstage drama narratives)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 4-5 (confirmed locked at line 120594 in tracker)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- HIDE-001: Hidden Personality (worker ego, loyalty affect demands)
- REL-001: Relationships (trust between promotions and workers)
- FEDER-001: Federation Identity (booking philosophy shapes exchange behavior)
- CROWD-001: Crowd Memory (fans remember invasions and betrayals)
- CONTRACT-001: Contract System (talent movement requires contract handling)

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact trust decay rates per betrayal type
- Threshold values for Desperation Mode triggers
- How long "Legendary Partnership" vs "Legendary Betrayal" memories persist
- Division autonomy rating mechanics

✅ **STATUS:** Locked

## 1. CORE CONCEPTS: RAIDS VS INVASIONS VS PARTNERSHIPS

### 1.1 Terminology Separation

| Term | Definition | Behind-the-Scenes Reality |
|------|------------|---------------------------|
| **Territory Raids** | Predatory worker poaching, stealing TV timeslots, weakening/killing rival territories | Hostile, no cooperation |
| **Invasions** | Storyline-driven appearances framed as outsiders vs home promotion | May or may not be hostile backstage |
| **Co-Promotion Shows** | Two+ promotions agree to co-host supercards, tournaments, exhibitions | Risky political minefields |
| **Talent Lending** | Temporary sharing of stars with conditions | Booking protection usually required |
| **Talent Trades** | Strategic exchange, rare | Only when both sides see clear benefit |

### 1.2 Historical Examples

| Event | Type | Outcome |
|-------|------|---------|
| Vince McMahon WWF Raids (1983-1985) | Predatory Raid | Stole TV timeslots, bought talent (Hogan, Piper, Heenan), killed territories |
| Crockett vs UWF (Mid-80s) | Hostile Merger | Crockett buried UWF stars, absorbed market share |
| All Japan / NOAH Talent Raids (2000) | Internal Exodus | NOAH formation gutted AJPW overnight |
| CZW vs ROH | Cooperative Invasion | Tension backstage mirrored real promotion pride, raised both |
| AEW and NJPW | Modern Partnership | Tense collaboration with mutual protection, poaching risk always present |
| WCW NWO "Invasion" | Fictional Invasion | Sold as reality, lawsuit risks (NJPW-style) |
| Choshu invasion of AJPW | Mid-80s Invasion | Outsiders arrive hot, alter booking landscape |
| AJPW lending Kawada to NJPW post-NOAH | Desperate Lending | Careful booking protection negotiated |

---

## 2. PROMOTION EXCHANGE PRIORITY TRAITS

Every promotion has semi-hidden Exchange Priority Traits that influence negotiation behavior.

### 2.1 Core Traits

| Trait | Description | Simulation Effect |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Star-Hungry** | Prioritizes trades/loans that deliver instant drawing power | Prefers booking megastars even if it costs credibility |
| **Style Purist** | Refuses trades that don't match house style identity | Rejects stylistic mismatches (e.g., garbage brawlers into King's Road) |
| **Territorial Protector** | Defensive of talent and reputation | Demands creative control clauses, refuses burial risk |
| **Talent Raider** | Treats trades and loans as scouting opportunities | Will poach loaned stars aggressively post-exchange |
| **Open Door Culture** | Sees cross-promotion as healthy | Easier to negotiate with, values mutual gain |
| **Paranoid Isolators** | Avoid cross-promotion unless desperate | Very rare to trade/loan, extreme demands if they do |
| **Hero Building Agenda** | Only accepts trades if they can put over homegrown stars | Demands outside stars lose or go even |
| **Dream Match Merchant** | Values fantasy booking and spectacle above politics | Tolerates losses if dream matches pop big |
| **Desperation Mode** (Temporary) | Triggered during financial peril or roster collapse | Overrides normal traits, accepts bad deals to survive |

### 2.2 Trait Interactions

| Situation | Trait Bias |
|-----------|------------|
| Propose short-term loan of megastar | Star-Hungry leaps at it; Style Purists check fit first |
| Offer a dream match (Flair vs Kobashi) | Dream Match Merchants prioritize even if risky |
| Trade a journeyman wrestler | Open Door may accept; Talent Raiders use it to scout |
| Book their champion to lose | Territorial Protectors refuse; Hero Builders demand different finish |
| Approach during financial collapse | Desperation Mode accepts almost anything temporarily |
| Approach paranoid promotions with risky ideas | Near impossible, may worsen relations just by asking |

### 2.3 Trait Visibility

| Info Layer | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Fully Hidden** | Traits hidden at game start unless scouted/unlocked |
| **Partial Clues** | Player notices behavior (refusal to loan, protectionism, booking patterns) |
| **Revealed by Trust** | After long relationships, backstage leaks, or scout reports, traits become visible |
| **Modifiable by History** | Desperation, scandal, financial boom/bust can mutate exchange behavior |

## 3. WHAT PROMOTIONS VALUE IN EXCHANGES

### 3.1 Evaluation Priorities

| Priority | Explanation | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Star Power Boost** | Will this give us box office, TV rating, or merch spike? | NJPW bringing in Moxley for short-term buzz |
| **Style Complement** | Does incoming wrestler fit or enrich promotion's style? | CMLL borrowing puroresu juniors who blend with lucha |
| **Talent Gap Filler** | Does this solve urgent roster hole? | WWF borrowing Road Warriors after Bulldogs left |
| **Political Trust Level** | Will other promotion honor handshake agreements? | AJPW/NJPW refusing to work with indies that burned bridges |
| **Worker Versatility** | Can they handle multiple styles without chaos? | Eddie Guerrero lent for Japan tours and WCW shows |
| **Potential Long-Term Gain** | Chance to poach this talent permanently? | ECW hosting Benoit/Malenko before WCW stole them |
| **Cultural/Regional Pull** | Will worker draw specific local audiences? | Inviting Mil Máscaras for LA shows to boost Latino fanbase |
| **Feud Setup Potential** | Will it allow dream matches or hot angles? | ROH vs NJPW supercards, Okada vs Strong styles |
| **Injury Risk Management** | Is talent reliable and durable? | Avoiding injury-prone freelancers |
| **Cost/Benefit Risk** | Does cost outweigh benefit? | Refusing to send rising star to be squashed |
| **Contractual Protection** | Safety clauses if things go wrong? | Modern companies demanding approval over finishes |

## 4. RELATIONSHIP LIFECYCLE

### 4.1 Stages

| Stage | Player/AI Actions |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Relationship Initiation** | Propose talent exchanges, co-promotion shows, storyline invasions. Based on trust, size disparity, need. |
| **Active Relationship** | Handle trades, loans, co-promos, raids, betrayal possibilities. Booking rules negotiation (protecting top guys). |
| **Tension Buildup** | Betrayals, booking disputes, poaching rumors. Tension meter rises. |
| **Conflict or Collapse** | Formal breakup (public scandal, storyline turn) or silent decay (workers jump ship, fans lose faith). |
| **Legacy Formation** | World memory logs: Legendary Partnership (rare) vs Legendary Betrayal (common). |

### 4.2 Talent Exchange Types

| Type | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Mutual Benefit** | Both promotions agree to share talent for fresh matchups, skill building |
| **Touring Apprenticeship** | Rookies sent abroad to gain experience (NJPW → Mexico tours, U.S. workers to Japan) |
| **Short-Term Storyline Loans** | Workers sent to spice up cold shows or fill cards after injuries |
| **Emergency Alliances** | Promotions in financial trouble lend/rent talent to survive (early TNA using AAA) |
| **Star Poaching Agreements** | Backdoor deals where "borrowed" stars are subtly nudged into jumping permanently |

### 4.3 Territory Invasion Types

| Type | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Open Invasion** | Workers arrive on shows, cutting "outsider" promos, attacking champs, claiming territory |
| **Silent Infiltration** | Workers show up as humble guests, slowly take over booking attention, angles, titles |
| **Full Takeover Attempt** | Invading workers become main-eventers, champions; native workers must defend pride |
| **Promoter Betrayal Invasions** | Promoters cooperate secretly, then one side pulls the rug |
| **Failure/Sabotage Risks** | Bad invasions collapse: fans reject outsiders, angles feel cold, locker room resentment explodes |

## 5. WORKER POST-LOSS DEMANDS SYSTEM

### 5.1 Triggers

| Trigger | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Worker loses in cross-promotion match | Especially humiliating losses (squash, burial, screwjob) |
| Worker personality supports it | High Ego + Low Loyalty = Very likely |
| | Moderate Ego + High Pride Tags = Somewhat likely |
| | Mercenary Goal Tag = Might not care if paid extra |

### 5.2 Possible Reactions

| Reaction Type | Example Outcomes |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Redemption Arc Demand** | "I want a storyline journey to rebuild credibility at home" |
| **Immediate Return Match Win** | "I'll do the job today, but I beat them decisively at our next show" |
| **Home Title Win Demand** | "I need a title run ASAP to reassert dominance" |
| **Revenge Booking Clause** | "I want to destroy a major star from their promotion in return" |
| **Financial Compensation** | "Pay me extra for taking the loss, then I'll shut up" |
| **Walkout Threat** | "If you don't fix this, I'll leave when my contract is up" |
| **No-Show Future Matches** | "I refuse to appear against them again. Find someone else." (The Hogan Special) |

### 5.3 Personality Factors

| Hidden Stat/Tag | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| **High Ego** | More likely to demand wins, titles, revenge booking |
| **Low Loyalty** | More likely to walk out, no-show, air grievances publicly |
| **Mercenary Instinct** | Will accept humiliation for enough money |
| **Traditionalism** | May care more about presentation than just wins/losses |
| **Drive** | If high, may push for Redemption Arcs instead of instant wins |
| **Paranoia** | May assume the loss was political move against them, even if it wasn't |

### 5.4 Pre-Match Resistance

Workers may refuse to show up for matches entirely:
- High Ego + Low Loyalty workers may no-show if they don't want to lose
- Historical example: Hogan backing out of planned Hogan vs Hansen AJPW/NJPW dome show headliner

---

## 6. BOOKING POLITICS SYSTEM

### 6.1 Core Rules

| Logic | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Protect Top Stars** | Promotions resist lending top guys unless guaranteed protective booking |
| **Return Match Clauses** | If top guy loses outside home turf, company demands return match with revenge finish |
| **Desperation Gambles** | Low cash/popularity promotions may allow stars to lose or trade prospects for short-term survival |
| **Backroom Betrayals** | Workers may jump to partners without permission, causing real fallout |
| **Booking Memory Tracking** | Fans, workers, bookers remember if you let stars get buried |

### 6.2 Cross-Promotion Booking ≠ Automatic Parity

- Booking parity is a **negotiation**, not a default
- Some bookers (like Choshu) only agree if their brand is protected visually, symbolically, emotionally
- Even if matches are "fair," narrative treatment matters (desperation, luck, surviving brutality)
- Some stars are sacrificed to make the booking legend grow elsewhere

### 6.3 Example: Choshu's NJPW Booking Style

When Choshu booked Onita in NJPW:
- Completely destroyed by himself and Chono in barbed wire death matches
- Onita with legendary entrances in the dome, smoking cigarette, leather jacket, basking in boos and garbage
- Framed as someone who would "tarnish the NJPW ring" with his deathmatch style

## 7. DIVISION BOOKER SYSTEM

### 7.1 Core Rules

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Division Bookers Optional** | Only promotions reaching certain size/complexity can/will appoint them |
| **Default Setting** | Most promotions operate under single head booker |
| **Triggers for Addition** | Roster size exceeds critical mass, Open Door philosophy, Prestige division needs |
| **Player Control** | Can appoint/dismiss Division Bookers manually if promotion size supports it |
| **AI Control** | AI promotions dynamically add/merge divisions based on roster/prestige |

### 7.2 Division Booker Impact

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Creative Variety** | Different divisions can have radically different booking flavors |
| **Internal Political Risk** | Division Bookers can become too powerful if division outshines main roster |
| **Career Paths** | Workers may find better pushes in divisions with bookers favoring their style |
| **Promotion Evolution** | Growing division can mutate whole company's style |

### 7.3 Example: NJPW 1990s

- **Heavyweight Division** (Choshu): Territorial Protector, Hero Building Agenda
- **Junior Division** (Liger): Dream Match Merchant, Open Door Culture
- Both operating semi-independently within overall NJPW "flavor"
- Political and booking differences influence feuds, alliances, crowd loyalty differently

### 7.4 Promotion Traits Evolve with Leadership

| Event | Effect on Traits |
|-------|------------------|
| **Booker Appointment/Change** | Traits immediately shift toward new booker's bias |
| **Owner Change** | Financially-driven traits shift first |
| **Cultural Evolution** | If internal values clash too much, locker room rebellion or exodus can happen |
| **Division Booker Fracture** | Different divisions may "feel" different to fans based on leadership |

---

## 8. FANBASE LOYALTY DIFFERENCES

### 8.1 Regional Patterns

| Region | Fanbase Behavior |
|--------|------------------|
| **Japan** | Many fans are hardcore into only 1-2 promotions, ignore the rest. Strong loyalty. |
| **USA** | More casual cross-promotion viewing. Fans will watch multiple promotions. |
| **Mexico** | Family loyalty to specific promotions, but less intense than Japan |

### 8.2 Invasion Impact by Region

| Region | Fan Reaction to Invasion |
|--------|--------------------------|
| **Japan** | Outsiders often deeply resented; "ring sanctity" matters |
| **USA** | Invasions can pop if booked well; fans more accepting |
| **Mexico** | Depends heavily on cultural framing and family traditions |

---

## 9. CULTURAL LEGACY OF INVASIONS

| Outcome | Fan Memory |
|---------|------------|
| **Legendary War** | Booking handled masterfully; creates multi-year feuds, dream matches, promotion growth (e.g., NJPW vs UWF, NWO early years) |
| **Mutual Growth** | Talent exchange breathes life into both promotions (e.g., NJPW-CMLL alliance) |
| **Bitter Collapse** | One promotion gets gutted; world memory records it as betrayal era (e.g., early 90s shoot style collapse) |
| **Forgotten Experiments** | Cold invasions fans forget after 6 months; world memory fades without anchor events |
