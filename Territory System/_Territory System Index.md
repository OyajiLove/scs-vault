# Territory System

📛 **SYSTEM ID:** TERR-001
🧭 **CATEGORY:** World Structure / Regional Dynamics
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** territory, region, regional loyalty, home turf, cross-territory, invasion, talent movement, territorial kingpin
📝 **SUMMARY:** 

The Territory System governs how wrestling operates across distinct geographic regions, each with unique crowd behaviors, booking expectations, and power structures. In the territory era (pre-1985 and Ringstate's 1985 setting), territories are semi-autonomous kingdoms where regional promoters control booking, talent, and presentation. Workers build regional loyalty, territorial kingpins wield local power, and cross-territory movement creates drama.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Territories are distinct geographic regions with unique crowd expectations
- Workers accumulate "regional popularity" separate from national popularity
- Territorial Kingpins have booking influence in their home region
- Cross-territory talent movement creates invasion angles and culture clashes
- Territory prestige affects worker contracts and fan expectations
- Regional TV deals determine territory economic viability

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Medium (generating regional flavor, crowd reactions, cultural context)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 1-4 (conceptual), Ringstate Atlas (regional worldbuilding), Hidden Personality (Territorial Kingpin archetype)

## Design Philosophy

The territory system existed historically (NWA territories, 1950s-1980s) and is central to Ringstate's 1985 setting. Territories aren't just geographic markers; they're cultural ecosystems with distinct identities, crowds, and politics.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Regional Identity Matters:** A worker's reception differs dramatically between Memphis and New York
2. **Local Kings:** Territorial Kingpins wield real power in their home region
3. **Outsider Dynamics:** Visiting talent face different crowd expectations
4. **Cultural Memory:** Territories remember betrayals, invasions, and heroes differently
5. **Economic Variation:** Territory size and TV deals determine earning potential

## Ringstate Territory Framework

The Ringstate world organizes territories by faction alignment:

| Faction | Territory Philosophy | Example Regions |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **CCA** | Traditional, regional autonomy | Southern US, Carolinas, Japan (IPWA) |
| **GWA** | Corporate, national/global | Major US markets, international expansion |
| **PWU** | State-controlled, ideological | Soviet territories, aligned nations |
| **CFPW** | Indigenous sovereignty | Pacific Northwest, reservations, autonomous zones |
| **LGBTQW+** | Safe haven circuits | Underground urban networks |
| **Blade** | Outlaw, no boundaries | Wherever they can run shows |

## Integration with Existing Systems

**With Popularity System:**
- Workers have separate regional popularity scores
- National popularity ≠ regional popularity
- Some workers are "territory stars" (high regional, low national)

**With Crowd Memory:**
- Regional crowds have distinct memory patterns
- Southern CCA: Long memory (5+ year grudges)
- Coastal GWA: Short attention span
- PWU: Collective institutional memory

**With Hidden Personality:**
- Territorial Kingpin archetype: High local influence, resents outsiders
- Regional loyalty affects contract decisions
- Home territory protection instincts

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1:** Regional popularity tracking, basic territory definitions
**Phase 2:** Cross-territory mechanics, invasion angles
**Phase 3:** Full territory economic simulation, TV deals
