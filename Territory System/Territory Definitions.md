## Territory Boundaries (Conceptual)

**Boundary Disputes:**
- Some workers claimed by multiple territories
- Boundary promotions may work both sides
- GWA expansion creates new contested zones

**Boundary Effects:**
- Workers from boundary areas: Dual loyalty possible
- Shows in boundary areas: Mixed crowd expectations
- TV coverage may cross boundaries

---

## Connected Mechanics

- [[Regional Loyalty]] - Worker-territory relationships
- [[Cross-Territory Movement]] - Movement between zones
- [[Regional Crowd Behavior]] - Territory-specific reactions
- [[_Popularity System Index|Popularity]] - Regional vs. national pop

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] Exact boundary definitions (county level? state level?)
- [ ] How do territories change over time (1985 → 1995)?
- [ ] International territory definitions (Japan, Mexico, UK)?
- [ ] Underground territory overlay (Blade, LGBTQW+ circuits)?
