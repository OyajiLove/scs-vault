## Overview

Territories and promotions have distinct operating philosophies that determine how they expand, compete, and treat talent. These personalities affect AI behavior in simulation and create strategic variety in the competitive landscape.

---

## TERRITORY PERSONALITY TYPES (#166)

How different territories/promotions approach competition:

| Type | Behavior | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Old Guard** | Tradition-focused, resists change, protects established ways | NWA traditionalists, CMLL |
| **Progressive** | Open to new styles, talent, and booking approaches | Early AEW, NOAH founding |
| **Cutthroat** | Will raid, sabotage, and crush competitors | Vince McMahon (80s), Choshu |
| **Cooperative** | Willing to share, build industry, mutual benefit | NWA alliance (original vision), NJPW-ROH |
| **Isolationist** | Doesn't interact with others, self-contained bubble | CMLL during cold war with AAA |

**Additional Personality Tags:**

| Tag | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| **Cutthroat** | Default to ruthless expansion, exploitative deals |
| **Pragmatic** | Seek alliances before war, fair but self-interested |
| **Cowardly** | Cave early under pressure, die quietly |
| **Idealistic** | May sacrifice profit for principles |
| **Opportunistic** | Jump on weakness, vultures on failing promotions |

---

## REGIONAL MARKET DYNAMICS (#167)

How markets behave and constrain promotion growth:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Market Size** | Limits potential gate/attendance ceiling |
| **Competition** | Multiple feds = audience split, price wars |
| **Cultural Preference** | Some markets prefer specific styles |
| **TV Access** | Critical for growth beyond regional |
| **Talent Pool** | Local vs. imported workers affects costs |

### Growth Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------|
| **Saturate Home Market** | Maximize gate in core territory first | Low |
| **Expand to Adjacent Regions** | Neighboring territories, shared travel routes | Medium |
| **National Expansion via TV** | TV deal enables coast-to-coast presence | High cost |
| **International Partnerships** | Talent trades, tour exchanges | Political complexity |

### Market Saturation

| Saturation Level | Effect |
|------------------|--------|
| **Under 50%** | Room to grow, easy gate expansion |
| **50-75%** | Competition for audience share begins |
| **75-90%** | Diminishing returns, quality must improve |
| **90%+** | Market saturated, must expand or contract |

## PROMOTER AI BEHAVIOR (#168)

How CPU promoters operate in simulation:

### Strategic Types

| AI Type | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| **Aggressive** | Raids talent, expands fast, high risk/high reward |
| **Conservative** | Protects territory, slow growth, stable but limited |
| **Erratic** | Unpredictable booking, boom/bust cycles |
| **Strategic** | Calculates moves carefully, long-term planning |

### Personality Impact on Decisions

| Personality | Talent Acquisition | Expansion | Competition | Alliance |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Cutthroat** | Raids aggressively | Rapid, hostile | Crush competitors | Exploits partners |
| **Pragmatic** | Fair offers, some poaching | Measured | Compete but survive | Genuine partnerships |
| **Cowardly** | Avoids bidding wars | Minimal | Folds under pressure | Submissive partner |
| **Idealistic** | Develops own talent | Principled | May refuse to compete | Values-based alliances |

### AI Decision Trees

**Talent Poaching:**
```
IF competitor_weakness DETECTED:
  IF personality = CUTTHROAT:
    RAID_AGGRESSIVELY
  ELIF personality = PRAGMATIC:
    MAKE_FAIR_OFFERS
  ELIF personality = COWARDLY:
    AVOID_CONFLICT
  ELIF personality = IDEALISTIC:
    RESPECT_CONTRACTS
```

**Expansion:**
```
IF market_opportunity DETECTED:
  IF financial_health > 0.7:
    IF personality = AGGRESSIVE:
      EXPAND_IMMEDIATELY
    ELIF personality = CONSERVATIVE:
      EVALUATE_RISK
    ELIF personality = STRATEGIC:
      PLAN_LONG_TERM
  ELSE:
    IF personality = ERRATIC:
      RANDOM_DECISION
    ELSE:
      DELAY_EXPANSION
```

## BOOKING PHILOSOPHY TAGS (#53)

Promotions have booking philosophies that affect match structure and storyline length:

| Philosophy | Description | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Long-Term Storytelling** | Multi-month arcs, protected finishes | Baba's AJPW, NWA territories |
| **Hot-Shot Booking** | Constant title changes, shock swerves | Late WCW, early TNA |
| **Workrate-Focused** | Match quality over storyline | ROH, NJPW strong style era |
| **Character-Driven** | Gimmicks and promos over matches | WWF 80s, Attitude Era |
| **Tradition-Bound** | Follows established formulas | CMLL, old territory style |
| **Experimental** | Tries new things, risks failure | ECW, Lucha Underground |

### Booker Adaptability

Not all bookers can change their approach:

| Adaptability | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| **Rigid** | Refuses to adapt, doubles down on what worked before |
| **Stubborn** | Slow to change, needs overwhelming evidence |
| **Flexible** | Adjusts based on feedback and results |
| **Reactive** | Pivots quickly based on audience response |

**Examples:**
- Vince McMahon (90s): Stubbornly pushed certain types until forced to change
- Dusty Rhodes (90s): Rigid, kept running same playbook
- Tony Khan (early AEW): Reactive, adjusted based on fan feedback

## INTER-PROMOTIONAL POWER DYNAMICS (#94, #107)

How promotions of different sizes interact, with power disparity shaping relationship terms.

### Core Concept

"Big dog abuses the shit out of little dog." Examples: NJPW to smaller Japanese promotions in the 90s/00s, WWF/E to British indie scene, AEW's dominance over NJPW and CMLL (though giving something in return).

### Relationship Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Talent Trade Agreements** | Workers move between promotions |
| **Talent Sharing Pacts** | Ongoing shared roster access |
| **Booking Partnerships** | Collaborative storylines |
| **Co-Promotions** | Joint shows and events |
| **Developmental Deals** | Big fed trains/scouts from small fed |

### Power Level Dynamics

| Power Level | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| **Dominant** | Sets terms, takes best talent |
| **Equal** | Negotiates fairly, mutual benefit |
| **Subordinate** | Accepts scraps, hopes for growth |

If one promotion is significantly bigger (size, prestige, financial clout), they dominate relationship terms. True mutual partnerships require relatively equal standing (rare).

### Promoter Personality in Negotiations

| Type | Negotiation Style |
|------|-------------------|
| **Cutthroat** (Vince, Choshu, late-80s Baba) | Exploitative deals, maximum extraction |
| **Pragmatic** (early AEW, Misawa) | More fair terms, sustainable relationships |
| **Passive or Desperate** | Get eaten alive |

### Benefits vs Risks for Smaller Promotions

| Benefit | Risk |
|---------|------|
| Boosted exposure (your talent wrestles bigger names) | Risk of champions jobbing to outsiders |
| Shared media access (bigger TV networks) | Risk of talent being scouted and poached |
| Credibility through association | Your titles devalued |
| Market expansion opportunities | Becoming a developmental farm |

### Poaching System (LOCKED)

- Bigger companies actively scout workers from smaller feds
- If they see potential (fan buzz, killer matches, good looks), they make offers or outright tamper
- Strong contracts and loyalty stats slow poaching but don't stop determined raiders

### Breaking Relationships

Bad blood (betrayal booking, poaching, sabotage) leads to:
- Talent sharing collapse
- Public fallout (social media, shoot interviews)
- Long-term enmity (won't work together for years, possibly decades)

## BOOKER ADAPTABILITY RATING (#162)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #162

### Core Mechanic

Formal attribute measuring how bookers respond to crowd feedback and changing circumstances.

| Adaptability Level | Behavior |
|-------------------|----------|
| **High (TK type)** | Pivots based on fan reaction, adjusts pushes, listens to feedback |
| **Medium** | Adjusts with significant evidence, somewhat flexible |
| **Low (Vince/Dusty type)** | Doubles down on vision, ignores rejection, risks death spiral |

### System Effects

| Booker Type | System Behavior |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Adaptable** | Gets soft suggestions: "Fans are hijacking the show for Takeshita. Consider adjusting plans." |
| **Stubborn** | Worker momentum tanks faster, fed reputation for "pushing wrong people" grows |
| **Rigid** | No suggestions, must face consequences to change course |

### Adaptability vs. Cultural Gravity

Even adaptable bookers face resistance:
- Cultural Gravity can resist changes that are too extreme
- Sudden pivots confuse crowds
- Some fanbases resist certain directions regardless

**Key Quote:** "TK pivots a lot based on feedback, which is usually great... Whereas most bookers are assholes and think they know better."
