## Overview

Territorial Loyalty represents a worker's attachment to their home region or adopted territory. High territorial loyalty workers resist leaving their turf, wield influence locally, and may become "Territorial Kingpins" who shape regional booking. Low loyalty workers travel freely but never become local icons.
