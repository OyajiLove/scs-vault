## Overview

Regional Loyalty tracks how strongly a worker is connected to a specific territory. This affects their popularity, political power, booking preferences, and willingness to move. Some workers are "territory lifers" who will never leave home; others are "road warriors" who have no territorial attachment.

---

## Loyalty Attributes

### Home Territory

Every worker has a designated home territory based on:
- Birth/origin location
- Training location (if different)
- Career start location (if different)

**Multiple Homes:** Some workers develop secondary home territories through long stays.

### Loyalty Rating

|--------|-------|-------------|
| **1-3** | Rootless | No territorial attachment, will go anywhere |
| **4-6** | Mobile | Prefers home but will travel for opportunity |
| **7-9** | Attached | Strong home preference, reluctant to leave |
| **10-12** | Loyal | Very strong attachment, needs major reason to leave |
| **13-15** | Devoted | Deeply tied, would sacrifice career for territory |
| **16-20** | Territorial Kingpin | Identity fused with territory, will never leave |
