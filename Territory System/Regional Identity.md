## Regional Identity Mechanics

### Crowd Expectation Matching

```
Regional Reception = Base Worker Popularity × Style Match Modifier
```

| Style Match | Modifier |
|-------------|----------|
| **Perfect Match** | 1.2x |
| **Good Match** | 1.0x |
| **Neutral** | 0.9x |
| **Poor Match** | 0.7x |
| **Terrible Match** | 0.5x |

**Example:** High-flyer in Southern CCA territory
- Base Pop: 60
- Style Match: Poor (South prefers brawling/psychology)
- Modifier: 0.7x
- Regional Reception: 42

### Outsider Penalty

New workers to a territory face an "outsider penalty" until they've proven themselves:

| Weeks in Territory | Outsider Penalty |
|--------------------|------------------|
| 0-4 weeks | -20% reception |
| 5-12 weeks | -10% reception |
| 13-26 weeks | -5% reception |
| 27+ weeks | No penalty |

**Modifiers:**
- Territorial Kingpin endorsement: -50% penalty duration
- Cultural respect shown: -25% penalty duration
- Disrespectful entrance: +50% penalty duration

## FAN CULTURE PER REGION (World Builder) (#47)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #47

Different regions have distinct fan value systems that affect what gets over:

| Region | Fan Values |
|--------|------------|
| **Japan** | Fighting Spirit, Hard Work, Grit |
| **Mexico** | High Flyer Drama, Lucha Libre Traditions |
| **US (80s)** | Big Characters, Simpler Matches |
| **US (2000s)** | Spectacle, Workrate, Mic Skills |
| **Modern Indie** | Deathmatches, Irony, In-Ring Precision |

**World Builder Application:**
- These values serve as sliders when creating custom territories
- Adjusting values changes what booking approaches succeed
- Era-sensitive: same region has different values across time periods

**Examples:**
- US 80s territory values "Big Characters" = promo-heavy, visual gimmicks matter more
- Japan values "Fighting Spirit" = comeback spots and resilience get huge pops
- Modern indie values "Irony" = meta-commentary, self-aware characters work
