## Movement Mechanics

### Exchange Agreements

```
Exchange Probability = (Territory Relationship × 0.4) + (Worker Value × 0.3) + (Mutual Benefit × 0.3)
```

| Territory Relationship | Base Probability |
|------------------------|------------------|
| **Allied** | 80% |
| **Friendly** | 60% |
| **Neutral** | 40% |
| **Tense** | 15% |
| **Hostile** | 5% |

### Invasion Angle Setup

**Requirements:**
1. Two territories with tense or hostile relationship
2. Worker(s) willing to appear as invaders
3. Storyline justification (title claim, personal feud, territory war)

**Phases:**
| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Provocation** | Comments, challenges from afar |
| **2. Incursion** | First appearance, run-in or attack |
| **3. Response** | Home territory retaliates |
| **4. Escalation** | Multi-man conflict, recruits on both sides |
| **5. Resolution** | Big match(es) to settle conflict |

### Defection Process

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Contract Status** | Check if worker can legally leave |
| **Negotiation** | New territory makes offer |
| **Decision** | Worker weighs options (see below) |
| **Announcement** | Departure becomes public |
| **Reaction** | Old territory responds (blacklist, legal, etc.) |
| **Debut** | Worker appears in new territory |

### Defection Decision Factors

```
Defection Probability = 
  (Contract Dissatisfaction × 0.25) +
  (New Offer Quality × 0.25) +
  (Territorial Loyalty Inverse × 0.20) +
  (Relationship with Booker × 0.15) +
  (Career Opportunity × 0.15)
```

## Culture Clash Mechanics

When workers move between territories with different styles:

### Style Adaptation

| Origin Style | Destination Style | Adjustment Period |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Similar** | Similar | 1-2 weeks |
| **Compatible** | Compatible | 3-4 weeks |
| **Different** | Different | 5-8 weeks |
| **Opposed** | Opposed | 10+ weeks (may never adapt) |

**Examples:**
- Strong Style → King's Road: Compatible (2-3 weeks)
- Lucha → Southern Brawling: Opposed (10+ weeks)
- Technical → Technical: Similar (1 week)

### Cultural Reception

| Factor | Positive Reception | Negative Reception |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Respects local tradition** | +15% pop | |
| **Disrespects local tradition** | | -25% pop |
| **Endorsed by local Kingpin** | +20% pop | |
| **Opposed by local Kingpin** | | -20% pop |
| **Style matches region** | +10% pop | |
| **Style clashes with region** | | -15% pop |
