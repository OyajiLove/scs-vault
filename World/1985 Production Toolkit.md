## Camera Setups

| Setup | Who Uses It | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **2-Cam Static + Ringside** | Most PWU/CFPW feds | One hardcam, one corner angle, + handheld ringside or apron cam |
| **Single Hardcam** | Low-end indies, CFPW affiliates, Lion's Path, Red Desert | Usually fixed tripod, often placed too high |
| **3-Cam "Broadcast Package"** | GWA majors, GCW, SZW | One hardcam, one wide angle, one handheld — edited live-to-tape |
| **Mobile Camcorder (VHS)** | Palestine, outlaw indies, Cross Roads Lucha | Tapes passed through traders and underground networks |

---

## Lighting & Atmosphere

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Basic Overhead Floods** | Fluorescent gym or rec center lighting — buzzes audibly on tape |
| **Spotlight Ring Lighting** | PWU, RBW, Ashura, some CCA shows — creates dramatic shadows, hides crowd |
| **Halogen Rigs** | GWA and GCW venues, especially arena shows — hot, hard lights |
| **Lantern/Oil Lamps** | Red Desert and Yemen small shows — literal lantern glow, surreal visuals |
| **Cigarette Smoke / Fog** | Unintentional "haze" in southern US and Japanese venues — gives filmic grime |

---

## Commentary Setups

| Setup | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Booth at Ringside** | Exposed table, wired mics, tons of interruptions | CCA, DTW, Midwest Ember |
| **Off-Camera Voiceover** | Audio dubbed post-match | PWU, Ashura Pro, sometimes CFPW |
| **Announcer Only (No Commentary)** | In-venue announcer calls finish, nothing else | Lion's Path, IJP, outlaw feds |
| **Studio Overlay** | Matches shown on local TV with studio wraparounds | HOTL, Cross Roads Lucha |

---

## Media Format & Distribution

| Format | Used By | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **VHS** | Universal | Bootlegs, trade comps, "Best Of" tapes |
| **Betamax** | Rare, higher-end | RBW government archiving, high-end Japan tours |
| **16mm Film** | Only for historical/ceremonial use | Rare HOTL or PWU summit events |
| **Public Access TV** | Common in US | Local time slots, often delayed airing |
| **Radio Call-In Shows** | Used for angles, feud continuation, "event rumors" | Big in St. Louis, Texas, Cross Roads |
| **Newsletter Writeups** | Dirt sheet era | Meltzer-style commentary, builds buzz over weeks/months |
| **Wall Posters / Handbills** | Still primary hype method | Often visually louder than the show itself |

---

## Production Tag System (Hidden Influence)

| Tag | Meaning | Affects |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **Low Fidelity Tape** | Murky visuals, uneven audio | Can increase cult appeal if matches were memorable |
| **Broadcast Studio Style** | Clean shots, fixed background | Decreases Believability for wild brawls, boosts Fluency segments |
| **Spotlight Isolation** | High drama, noir energy | Increases Menace/Believability if used correctly |
| **Crowd Bleed** | Mic bleed, echoing yells | Enhances Selling and Drama metrics |
| **Dubbed Commentary** | Disjointed tone, clarity over heat | Lowers Brawling intensity unless overdub is strong |

---

## Buzz Implications (from Vol 3)

Modern viral moments (drone shots, laser lighting, etc.) are explicitly locked out of 1985's simulation layer.

Buzz and legacy for a show is earned via right-place-right-time exposure:
- Local radio drops
- Territory newsletter rumors
- Critical segments making it to VHS compilation or the Observer
