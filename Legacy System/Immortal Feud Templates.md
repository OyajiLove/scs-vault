## Overview

Not every rivalry is about hate. Some are about legacy, reverence, or proving you belong.

Feuds with Cultural Immortals operate differently:
- No betrayals
- No "heat"
- No title chase

Instead: spiritual inheritance, respect, or shaking the heavens to test your soul.

## Template Types

| Template | Purpose |
