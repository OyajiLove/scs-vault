## Overview

> "We're not simulating a goodbye. We're staging a ritual."

Tools for scripting career-closing, legacy-sealing, or myth-reinforcing events. Not just matches, but emotionally loaded memory generators.

## Ceremony Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🎤 Retirement Event | Worker's final show: match, speech, ceremony, video package |
| 🎭 Gimmick Funeral | Death of persona for reinvention or narrative closure |
| 🎭 Mask Tribute | Mask removed, passed down, or burned in-ring |
| 🏆 Title Surrender | Voluntary belt relinquishing for legacy reasons |
| 🧍 HOF Induction | On-show or separate media event (affects Legacy + Buzz) |
| 🛶 Last Tour | 5-10 show arc with tribute matches, memorial graphics, crowd chants |
| 🕯️ Posthumous Tribute | For legends who passed or retired offscreen (crowd memory trigger) |

Each triggers emotional logic, memory reinforcement, and potential push-on effects for others.

## AI Booker Behavior

| Booker Type | Ceremony Logic |
|-------------|----------------|
| Star Maker | Plans full-match farewell, visual tribute, commentary weight |
| Traditionalist | Prefers solemnity, historical references, old-school tag involvement |
| Heat Merchant | May interrupt ceremony for future feud launch (risky!) |
| Chaos Booker | May book gimmick funerals, but rarely retirement respect arcs |
| Purist | Honors mask and career boundaries (especially lucha/joshi) |
| Realist | Keeps it short unless legacy is undeniable |
