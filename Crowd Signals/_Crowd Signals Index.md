# Crowd Signals System

📛 **SYSTEM:** Crowd Signals & Chants
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Crowd Psychology / Audience Response
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** crowd signals, chants, region-era, heat, ceremony, garbage throwing, heel drift
📝 **SUMMARY:** A system simulating crowd language, emotion spikes, and audience rituals that reflect not just response volume but emotional meaning. Chants and signals are region-locked and era-locked, with distinct behaviors for 80s Southern US crowds vs 2020s smark audiences vs Japanese puro crowds.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Crowds express themselves through typed signals (chants, claps, silence, throwing)
- Signal availability is gated by Region and Era profiles
- Ceremonies have special response rules (retirements, tributes, mask handoffs)
- Modern heels face the Heat vs Hate paradox (being too cool to be hated)
- Heel to Face Drift tracks when crowds organically turn villains
- Chants persist in memory, can be reactivated, and can be weaponized against booking

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes. LLM generates contextual chant text for match summaries, interprets crowd behavior for commentary, and creates region-appropriate fan reactions.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 6 (fully formalized)
