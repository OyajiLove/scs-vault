## Overview

In the modern era, being "too good" at being bad makes you popular. Heat and Hate have diverged.

- **Heat** = Crowd reaction volume (boos, venom, chaos)
- **Hate** = Actual crowd rejection (no ironic cheers, no cool-factor loyalty)

In the 80s, these were the same. In the 2020s US/UK, they've split.

## Tracked Metrics

| Variable | How Tracked |
|----------|-------------|
| **Boo Volume** | Chant engine; are they booed hard and consistently? |
| **Ironic Pop Risk** | Fanbase segments start chanting for them during heat moments |
| **Catchphrase Adoption** | Are fans echoing heel promos, shirts, poses? |
| **Segment Hijack Risk** | Does crowd derail the segment? |
| **Heel Aura Integrity** | Combines Paranoia, Menace, Morality, Presentation Tags |

---

## System Outcomes

| Behavior | Booking Impact |
|----------|----------------|
| **Heat + Hate** | Heel is working; crowd wants them gone |
| **Heat - Hate** (Cool Heel) | Push resistance starts; faces get buried, chants go off-script |
| **No Heat, No Hate** | Gimmick is dying; crowd is silent or mocking |
| **Resentment Pop** | "Boo because it's fun"; AI may misread as success |

## Modern Heel Degeneration Causes

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Heel too cool/good** | Gains ironic support (MJF pre-2023) |
| **Truth-bomb promos** | Fans cheer harshness if targets hated authority |
| **Anti-hero posing/badass gear** | Fans drift to "we respect the work" |
| **Overbooked screwjobs** | Fans blame booker not heel |

## Tools for Maintaining True Hate

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **"No Merch" Clause** | Refuse to release heel merch (resists cool-factor drift) |
| **Scorned Segment Tone** | Book segments as cruel, uncomfortable, not performative |
| **Target Beloved Workers** | Use heel to insult/attack [[Gimmick System/Cultural Immortality|Immortals]], legends |
| **Cheap Heat Flags** | City insults, kid bullying, off-limits mic work |
| **Stifled Finish Booking** | Heels win via groan-worthy tactics, not cleverness |
| **Isolation Protocol** | Deny heel hot feuds; keep in miserable heel vortex |

## Connected Mechanics

- [[Heel to Face Drift]] - when Heat without Hate causes organic turn
- [[Region Era Profiles]] - paradox strongest in modern US/UK
- [[Chant Memory]] - catchphrase adoption tracked here
- [[Turn_Engine|Turn Engine]] - may process forced turn if drift too strong

---

## Open Questions

- Heat/Hate ratio formula for drift calculation
- Era transition (when did the split start? Late 90s? 2000s?)
- Regional variation (does Japan have this problem?)
