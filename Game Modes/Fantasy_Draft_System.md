## Version History

| Version | Source | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1.0 | Vol 5 + Vol 1 | 🔒 LOCKED |

## Core Concept

Fantasy drafts in SCS are player-initiated simulations. You start with a pool of workers (real, fictional, mixed, historical) and either solo or with other players, draft rosters to build new promotions.

It's creative, chaotic, and fun as hell, but still grounded in SCS emotional memory.

---

## Fantasy Draft Use Cases ✅ LOCKED

| Mode | Context |
|------|---------|
| **Creative Mode (Single Player)** | Build a new promotion from scratch using a mixed pool of legends, up-and-comers, and cult favourites |
| **Multiplayer Draft** | You and friends draft against each other in a live or asynchronous environment, each building a unique promotion |
| **Legacy World Reset** | After simming 40 years, do a full restart draft using all surviving workers (retired, active, semi-active) to form a new territory war era |
| **Scenario Start** | Load a "What if?" (e.g., What if New Japan collapsed in 2004 and a new world order emerged?) |

---

## Fantasy Draft Mechanics ✅ LOCKED

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Draft Pools** | Any mix of real, fictional, or AI-generated workers. Full control of active roster pool. |
| **Peak Draft Option** | Draft workers in their all-time peak versions. Attributes boosted accordingly. |
| **Draft Styles** | Traditional (snake draft), randomized, auction, protect/unprotect systems |
| **Package Deals** | Road Warriors, Steiners, Hardy Boyz, Midnight Express with Cornette. Smart package logic. Player prompted to draft together or risk morale hits. |
| **Live Reactions** | AI workers react in real time to being picked, passed over, drafted solo, or drafted with stables. Commentators cover shocks (e.g., Hogan slipping deep into the draft). |
| **Custom Rules** | Max roster size, salary caps, mandatory archetype diversity (must draft a Technician, a Brawler, etc.). Only 1 mythic legend per promotion. Only 2 current champions. Must take 3 unpushed midcarders per 10 picks. |
| **Protect Lists** | Existing promotions can protect top stars during real-world era drafts (optional) |
| **Hidden Gems** | Some workers marked as underrated have breakout potential post-draft if booked properly. Scouting reports may mislead (Austin example). |
| **Draft Position Memory** | Draft position affects ego, loyalty, morale (picked 45th = chip on shoulder arc) |
| **Tag Team & Stable Integrity** | Breaking historic bonds (Animal without Hawk) causes backstage morale crashes. Optional toggle: draft together (preserves loyalty web) or draft separately (fractures locker room). |
| **Worker Resistance** | Rare cases where workers refuse to sign after being drafted depending on loyalty, ego, and fit (Brody doesn't want to work for New York) |
| **Post-Draft Genesis** | Game generates initial feuds, belts, alliances, backstage dynamics immediately after draft based on choices |

---

## After the Draft ✅ LOCKED

| Layer | Outcome |
|-------|---------|
| **Promotion Culture Roll** | Based on your drafted mix of personalities, styles, and past baggage, the promotion generates a starting emotional soul |
| **Fanbase Seeding** | First draft shapes fanbase memory. Drafting 5 indie darlings = smart mark bias. Picking 4 overhyped freaks = fan trust will be shaky. |
| **Narrative Launch Tools** | Game suggests 3 early feuds, 2 potential emotional arcs, 1 betrayal arc (based on hidden loyalty fracture). You can ignore or use to jumpstart storytelling. |

**This is where you become the myth-builder.**

---

## Eternal Champions Special Layer (All-Time Peak Drafts) ✅ LOCKED

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **All-Time Database** | Workers from any era at their peak, one draft pool |
| **Promotion DNA** | If building Eternal WWF, WCW, ECW, NJPW, AJPW, etc., workers sorted by style DNA compatibility |
| **Draft Strategy Complexity** | You can't just stack main eventers. Locker room instability if ego balance isn't managed. |
| **"What If?" Toggle** | Allow crazy alt-history (Sting jumps to WWF in 1992, etc.) |
| **Multi-Prime Option** | Option to draft different versions of same workers (e.g., '86 Surfer Sting vs '97 Crow Sting) |
| **Fantasy Worldbuilding** | Draft defines entire fictional world tone: Deathmatch Era? Strong Style Era? Hybrid Feds? |

---

## Historic Time-Lock Drafts ✅ LOCKED

Want to do a 1994-only draft? Or a "What if the Attitude Era never ended?" fantasy world?

- Use the year filter to draft only workers active in a certain time window
- Or generate AI workers "as if" they were alive in a fictional year

**Perfect for:**
- Alt-history worlds
- Mixed-timeline dream feds
- Ironically fucked up pairings (imagine 2000 Kawada drafted into an '80s U.S. southern promotion)

---

## Anachronistic Draft Mode ✅ LOCKED

**Concept:** Draft from an era-mixed pool where all time periods are available simultaneously. CM Punk and Bruno Sammartino in the same draft. Like OOTP Baseball's random debuts feature.

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Anachronistic Draft** | You draft from a pool containing workers from all eras at once. Full player control over picks. |
| **Anachronistic Random Rosters (No Draft)** | Rosters are pre-randomized across eras. Workers just appear on rosters without a draft event. Pure chaos sandbox. |

**Use Cases:**
- Cross-era dream matches without historical constraints
- "What if?" scenarios (1986 WWF with 2020s workers)
- Pure sandbox chaos
- OOTP-style randomized starts

See also: [[Random_Debuts_System]] for non-draft anachronistic options.

---

## Real-World Parallels

- The Deadlock boys' fantasy fed
- Old EWR draft games on forums
- Modern TEW multiplayer scenarios
- WWE 2K Universe Mode DIY bookings, but with emotional memory and real fallout

**This is sandbox booking with a soul.**

---

## Philosophy

> "Fantasy Drafts in SCS are fun-first, player-led simulations that become booking puzzles, myth-generating events, relationship powder kegs, and creative playgrounds with real emotional stakes. You choose the workers. The world reacts like it's real."

## v2.0 Enhancements (Vol 5 lines 1036-1040) ✅ LOCKED

### Promoter/Booker Drafting Skill

| Skill Level | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| **Low Skill** | AI might pick ego bomb early, mismatch styles, ignore red flags |
| **High Skill** | Balances chemistry, myth-building, ego control, crowd expectations |
| **Special Archetypes** | Some bookers favor maverick picks, cult faves, undervalued journeymen |

**Draft is a reflection of each promotion's leadership.**

### Draft Broadcast & Personalities (SCS's "Mel Kiper")

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mock Draft** | Pre-draft mock, updated periodically |
| **Big Board** | Ranks top available by projected value (skill, mystique, soul fit, buzz) |
| **Live Commentary** | Reactions to shocking reaches, big board fallers, trade steals, reunions/breakups. Can be toggled off. |
| **Co-Anchor Styles** | Cynic (shits on picks), Historian (legacy references), Agent (locker room focus), Overhype Machine ("the next Rock!") |
| **Draft Grades After** | Biased emotional tone, not pure logic ("What were they thinking? This locker room will collapse by June!") |

### Trades System

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Pick for Pick** | Classic style. Can include picks from that night that haven't been used (e.g., WWF trades Triple H for DDP + WCW's 2nd and 3rd round picks) |
| **Pick for Worker** | Trade recently drafted workers for higher-value picks |
| **Multi-Promotion Deals** | 3-way or 4-way trades (rare, chaotic) |
| **Draft Day Bombshells** | AI generates shocking mid-draft trades based on promoter personality, desperation, or ego |

Optional toggle for those who want pure drafting vs full sandbox.

### Auction Drafts

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Cash-Based Auction** | Bidding format, each worker goes up one at a time |
| **Promotion-Based Budget** | Large feds = big budgets, indies = underdogs |
| **Random Budget** | Complete chaos |
| **Parity Mode** | Every fed starts with same funds |

**Budget Memory:** AI tracks who overspends and reacts later in booking world ("they blew it all on 2 guys, now their midcard is barren").

### Non-Wrestler Inclusion

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Main Draft Toggle** | Include managers, agents, commentators, referees in main pool, or keep to wrestlers only |
| **Support Draft Mode** | Optional second draft round for support staff only (after wrestler draft ends) |
| **Combined Roster Synergy** | Picking legendary agent with aligned workers grants bonuses. Mismatched team (Dutch Mantell managing Hiromu Takahashi) causes backstage tension unless reconciled. |

### Draft Vibe Toggles

| Option | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **"Realistic" Mode** | Clean, classic, focused on good builds |
| **"Chaos" Mode** | Trades, insults, walkouts, pick rejections, shock picks |
| **"Historical Roleplay"** | Players + AI act in-character. Vince doesn't touch lucha. Giant Baba won't pick sex symbol gimmicks. |

### Era-Based Draft Visuals

Draft presentation changes based on simulated era:
- **'70s:** Retro look, bell bottoms, red coats, loud ties, Mick Jagger hair, fuzzy screen filter
- **'80s-'90s:** Sports coats at desk in front of big stage
- **Modern:** Clean production, wrestlers wearing brand jerseys like NFL/NBA draft
- **Future Tech:** When tech allows, actual draft show with real commentary

### Future/Recurring Drafts

- Every year or every 5 years (customizable)
- Smaller draft where you can protect a certain number of roster members
- Creates ongoing roster drama and protection strategies

---

## Draft Trade Logic (Vol 5 line 1062) ✅ LOCKED

### Trade Evaluation System (AI)

| Factor | AI Behavior |
|--------|-------------|
| **Perceived Value** | Skill ratings, draw power, emotional memory (big matches, betrayals), current push status |
| **Needs-Based Logic** | Roster gaps: style, star power, locker room stability |
| **Promotion Personality** | Conservative feds avoid complex trades. Aggressive/chaotic feds throw dice. |
| **Ego & Pride** | High Ego owners may reject deals to avoid "looking weak." Low Loyalty = cutthroat. |
| **Desperation Modifier** | Poor ratings/morale = suddenly open to losing key stars for picks/cash |
| **Rivalry Tension** | Promotions with heat refuse trades unless offer is too good. Personal history overrides logic. |

**AI is emotional and biased, not perfectly optimized, but believable.**

### Draft Day Trade Scenarios

| Example | AI Commentary |
|---------|---------------|
| Gave up #2 pick for losing streak guy | "Someone in the back knows something… or they're panicking." |
| WWF stole WCW's midcard anchor + 3rd round pick | "Ruthless. That's going to sting for years." |

**Every trade becomes booking fuel, scandal trigger, or locker room memory seed.**

### Draft Busts and Late Bloomers (Clarified)

❌ **What We're NOT Doing:**
- No fixed ceilings or "hard caps"
- No "D+ Potential" destiny rolls like TEW
- No predetermined career limits

✅ **What We ARE Doing:**
Busts and late bloomers emerge from:
1. Hidden ratings (Drive, Adaptability, Composure, Ego, Loyalty)
2. Booking context (soul fit, match success, crowd reaction, locker room)
3. Fan/media narrative (hype vs delivery)
4. Who believed in them and what stories were told

| Trait | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Drive** | High = more likely to evolve, improve, push for greatness |
| **Adaptability** | High = adjusts to fed's style, locker room, match flow |
| **Composure** | High = handles setbacks, late draft, slow pushes |
| **Booking Fit** | Contextual flag, bad fit = early awkwardness unless booking adjusts |

**Narratives are reversible. Workers who start cold can heat up years later. Workers with high traits can still flop if booked badly.**

### Draft Memory Fallout

| Effect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Passed Over** | Worker remembers who ignored them. Promos reference it. May refuse future contracts. |
| **Drafted by Enemy** | May cause drama, morale collapse, or politic for trade |
| **Undrafted** | Morale hits. May go indie/international. Some retire bitter. Some reinvent as monsters. |
| **Late Round Gems** | Promotions that hit on "steals" get Fan Trust Boost, reputation as smart booking team |
| **Trade Regret Arcs** | "You gave up him for this?!" = long-term emotional baggage fans remember |

**Draft is not a phase, it's an origin story.**

---

## Trades Outside Draft (Vol 5 line 1065) ✅ LOCKED

Trades exist at all times, not just on Draft Day.

| Trade Type | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| **Worker-for-Worker Swaps** | Can be public (kayfabe) or behind-the-scenes |
| **Worker + Cash for Pick** | Feds sell contracts, often when financially desperate |
| **Contract Buyouts** | Cash-only or talent swap deals for locked contracts |
| **Trade Refusals** | Worker may refuse to report if they hate the destination |
| **Rival Trade Friction** | Harder to negotiate with bitter rivals unless lopsided deal |
| **Trade Motivation Tags** | Offload high-ego workers, cash in on hot talent, fill morale void post-scandal |
| **Scouting Tag Influence** | High-scouting staff better evaluate under-the-radar targets or avoid bad fits |

**Fully dynamic system tied to loyalty, ego, negotiation skill, and world emotional history.**
