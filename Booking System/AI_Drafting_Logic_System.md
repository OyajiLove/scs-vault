# AI Drafting Logic System

📛 **NAME:** AI Drafting Logic System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Booking System / AI Behavior  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** AI, draft, logic, style fit, soul, personality, weights, promotion type  
📝 **SUMMARY:** How AI-controlled promotions make draft picks. They don't just pick "the best available worker." They draft based on promotion soul, booking style, locker room chemistry, ego management, popularity vs control tension, and long-term emotional arcs. Vince isn't drafting Misawa early because he doesn't fit the style, doesn't fit the locker room, can't be controlled.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 13 weighted draft factors: Style Fit, Soul Alignment, Popularity vs Control, Personality Fit, Relationship Web, Booking Flexibility, Legacy Value, Feud Potential, Injury Risk, Microwave vs Crockpot, National Identity, Fan Base Trust, Pure Attribute Total
- 6 draft style profiles by promotion type
- Bad fit rejection logic (why AI passes on some stars)
- 4 optional draft personality toggles for scenario variety

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (LLM can explain AI draft reasoning, generate pick commentary, describe rejection logic)

## Core Concept

AI-controlled promotions don't just pick "the best available worker." They draft based on:
- Promotion soul & founding myth
- Booking style preference
- Locker room chemistry
- Ego management
- Popularity vs control tension
- Long-term emotional arcs

So no, Vince isn't drafting Misawa early. Because his brain is screaming: "Doesn't fit the style. Doesn't fit the locker room. Can't control him."

**Perfect.**

## Weighted Draft Factors (AI Pick Logic) ✅ LOCKED

| Weight | Factor | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 🔥 High | **Style Fit** | AI picks workers that align with their fed's in-ring philosophy. Southern territory = Psychology and Brawling high. Strong-style fed = Legitimacy and Durability > Glamour. |
| 🔥 High | **Promotion Soul Alignment** | Workers must match the emotional identity of the company. A ruthless heel-led fed may avoid pure babyfaces early. |
| 🔥 High | **Popularity vs Control Tension** | AI avoids picking workers with too much star power too early if they fear booking pushback. High Ego + Low Loyalty = slippery slope. |
| 🔥 High | **Personality Fit** | Hidden traits (Traditionalism, Morality, Ego) are weighted. A moralistic fed won't draft known sex pests. A paranoia-riddled locker room won't want a known manipulator. |
| 🔥 High | **Relationship Web Fit** | AI drafts workers who strengthen existing relationships or help mend potential fractures. Drafting Arn + Flair together stabilizes locker room early. Drafting Cornette + Midnight Express = instant heat and stability. |
| 🔥 High | **Booking Flexibility** | Adaptable workers are picked higher by experimental promotions. Stubborn stylists fall later unless style is a perfect fit. |
| ⚖ Medium | **Legacy Value** | Older, mythic stars get picked only if the AI believes they can emotionally anchor the fed long-term. Otherwise, they drop. |
| ⚖ Medium | **Feud Potential** | AI simulates early feuds based on pick momentum. Will sometimes draft enemies or complements just to book a strong opener. |
| ⚖ Medium | **Injury Risk / Durability** | Injury-prone workers fall down boards for long-term fed stability builds. |
| ⚖ Medium | **Microwave vs Crockpot Booking** | AI tendencies: Some feds want instant main eventers. Others want to slow-cook loyalty arcs. This affects pick pace. |
| ⚖ Medium | **National Identity/Region Bias** | American feds tend toward American workers unless they've already been westernized. Japanese promotions rarely pick outsiders early unless emotional logic permits it. |
| ⚖ Medium | **Fan Base Trust** | AI avoids picking "controversial" workers early if it could trigger initial fan distrust of the promotion. (Jeff Jarrett picked Round 1 = crowd morale bomb.) |
| 🔽 Low | **Pure Attribute Total** | AI rarely just picks the "best" stat worker. If a 19-skill guy doesn't emotionally fit? He falls. Stats don't override soul fit. |

## Draft Style Profiles Per Promotion Type ✅ LOCKED

| Promotion Archetype | Draft Personality |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Corporate Megafed** | Balances control with stardom. Prefers charisma, loyalty, mainstream booking. Avoids style cliques. |
| **Outlaw Indie** | Picks loyalty-first, adaptability-heavy, emotionally honest mid-tier stars. Avoids "fake pop" workers. |
| **Joshi Prestige** | Picks psychology, durability, and drive. Low tolerance for ego. Locker room balance is king. |
| **Hardcore / Deathmatch Fed** | Picks toughness, chaos affinity, psychology. Believability > polish. Often skips over "pure workers." |
| **King's Road Epic Fed** | Picks for myth-building. Prefers emotionally scarred warriors and slow-build feuds. Booking memory > marketability. |
| **Rebellion Fed** | Picks underdogs, DIY workhorses, and misfits. Rarely selects legacy stars early. Heat is earned. |

**You'll feel who each AI promotion is by how they draft.**

## What Makes a Bad Fit? (Why AI Passes on Some Stars) ✅ LOCKED

| Example | Rejection Logic |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Misawa in early WWE** | Too stoic, uncooperative aura, doesn't play the "TV champion" game. Personality mismatch. |
| **2006 CM Punk in '90s All Japan** | Strong promos, bad style fit, emotional brand mismatch. |
| **Bruiser Brody in modern WWE** | Too unpredictable, high Ego, won't play nice in PR-heavy environment. |
| **Kenny Omega in old school NWA** | Booking style and fluency way too eccentric. Confuses the AI fed's emotional soul logic. |

---

## Optional Draft Personality Toggles ✅ LOCKED

| Toggle | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Ruthless Poacher** | AI will prioritize screwing your board over roster fit. Chaos incarnate. |
| **Archetype Collector** | AI tries to fill its roster with one of every type, for pure creative variety. |
| **Legacy Rebuilder** | AI prioritizes workers who restore emotional prestige, even if risky personalities. |
| **Loyalty Obsessive** | AI picks safe personalities only. Pushes emotional stability > star power. |

**Great for scenario variety and personality-driven feds.**

## Philosophy

> "AI Draft Logic is soul-aware. They don't just pick good workers, they pick the right workers for their emotional vision. You can learn what each fed wants by who they avoid. And you can play around their logic by baiting traps, manipulating memory, or just letting fate spin the wheel."

## Rebalanced Weights (Vol 5 line 1040) ✅ LOCKED

**User correction:** Skills and draw power should NOT be low priority. Guys like Hogan and HBK are still worth it because of their drawing power. Abilities/skills are really important. Vince still won't pick Misawa over his boys, but skill should be taken into account, especially by promotions that emphasize in-ring quality.

| Factor | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **In-Ring Ability** | 🔥 High (in most feds) | Never ignored. Technical/psych-heavy feds prioritize heavily. Even WWF considers it, just lower than draw. |
| **Draw Power Composite** | 🔥 High | Popularity + emotional memory + booking history + aura + alignment with promotion myth |
| **Control/Fear of Pushback** | ⚖ Medium-High | Major weight in unstable feds, but huge stars still taken because they win wars if managed |
| **Locker Room Stability** | ⚖ Medium | Avoids multiple ego bombs in a row. Smart AIs draft stability guys. |
| **Soul/Style Fit** | 🔥 High | Especially for in-world feds. No purostar in early '90s WWF unless Americanized. |
| **Historical Loyalty** | ⚖ Medium-High | Post-collapse feds may avoid workers known to have jumped ship |

**AI draft logic is smart but emotional. Skills, draw, and fit are weighted seriously. Pushback fear is real but not fatal.**

## Draft Decision Committees (Vol 5 line 1040) ✅ LOCKED

| Role | Influence Type |
|------|----------------|
| **Owner/Promoter** | Branding vision, risk tolerance, economic scaling |
| **Head Booker** | Talent arcs, style fit, booking potential |
| **Creative/Agents/Committee** | Locker room chemistry, feud logic, "gut feel" picks |
| **Player Options** | Override all, take majority vote, or watch chaos unfold |

Each voice gets weight based on power structure + personality. In unstable companies (late WCW), draft decisions may be fractured or contradictory. In ego-driven structures, one voice might dominate.

## Mel Kiper Clone Commentary (Vol 5 line 1040) ✅ LOCKED

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Big Board Focus** | Obsessed with draw power, mainstream appeal, "marketability." ("Misawa is good, but can he cut a promo on Raw?" "Don't love the fit, but this guy moves merch.") |
| **Biases** | Underrates international workers unless they have proven emotional/draw memory. Loves known promo monsters. |
| **Mock Draft & Live Reactions** | Critiques reaches, praises "value picks," overreacts to trades. Has clear favorites. |
| **Co-Host Styles** | Cynic (shits on picks), Historian (legacy references), Agent (locker room focus), Overhype Machine ("the next Rock!") |

Can be toggled off. Can have visual presence at draft desk. Varies tone/fashion based on era simulation.
