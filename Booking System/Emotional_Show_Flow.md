# EMOTIONAL SHOW FLOW SYSTEM

📛 **NAME:** Emotional Show Flow (Booking Engine Phase 4)  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Show Pacing, Crowd Stamina & Emotional Architecture  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** show structure, emotional rhythm, crowd burnout, stamina drain, match pacing, peak memory, emotional tags  
📝 **SUMMARY:**

The Emotional Show Flow system quantifies the emotional rhythm and pacing of entire shows, tracking crowd energy/stamina throughout the card. Not every show is remembered equally: pacing, emotional balance, and strategic cool-downs determine whether a show feels legendary or exhausting. The system prevents common pitfalls like back-to-back MOTY attempts (desensitization) or constant spotfests (burnout).

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Each show has an overall structure type (DNA preset) that sets crowd expectations
- Every match/segment carries emotional intent tags (Courage, Betrayal, Catharsis, etc.)
- Crowd has Energy Meter and Stamina that drains from big matches, emotional investment, or long runtime
- Burnout triggers when: back-to-back peak matches, no cool-downs, emotional oversaturation, misaligned pacing
- Post-show analysis scores: Emotional Build Logic, Burnout Risk, Card Escalation, Emotional Palette Variety, Peak Memory Anchors
- System warns booker when show structure will cause fatigue, desensitization, or crowd apathy
- Balance matters: stacking 3 betrayals + bloody match + screwjob = too much emotional weight even if quality is high

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes: LLM can analyze show emotional arcs, suggest pacing adjustments, identify burnout risks, and recommend cool-down segments

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol. 2 (concept foundations like opener placement, intermission logic), Vol. 3-4 (Phase 4 locked with full system)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** [[Booking_Engine_P1-3]], [[Crowd_Memory]], Match Engine, Venue Logic, Worker Morale, AI Booker Philosophies

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**

- Exact stamina drain formulas per match type/length
- Regional/era variations in burnout tolerance (Japanese crowds vs. US crowds)
- How do "palate cleanser" comedy segments restore stamina?

✅ **STATUS:** LOCKED (Vol 3-4 as Phase 4 of Booking Engine)

## EMOTIONAL CLIMAX HIERARCHY (#151)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #151

### Shows Should Build Toward Emotional Peaks

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Opening** | Hook audience, set energy |
| **Build** | Escalate stakes and investment |
| **Cool Down** | Strategic rest for bigger peaks |
| **Climax** | Maximum emotional payoff |
| **Denouement** | Resolution, setup for future |

**Anti-Pattern:** Front-loading all action leaves nothing for main event.

## MOMENT-BASED STORYTELLING TAGS (#183)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #183

### Tags That Mark Pivotal In-Match Moments

| Tag | Trigger | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| **Desperation Spot** | Worker visibly exhausted but keeps fighting | Crowd investment spike |
| **Near Fall Drama** | Believable near-pin | Energy surge |
| **Comeback Fire** | Face begins rally | Pop building |
| **Heel Cutoff** | Heel stops momentum | Heat amplification |
| **Fighting Spirit** | Refusing to stay down | Emotional resonance |
| **Hope Spot** | Brief advantage for underdog | Crowd rises |

**These moments compound for match ratings.** A match with multiple well-executed story beats rates higher than one relying purely on moves.

## EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION POINTS (#203)

📌 **Source:** Vol 1 Extraction #203

### Crowds Have Finite Emotional Energy Per Show

| Match Type | Exhaustion Cost |
|------------|----------------|
| **Squash** | 1 point |
| **Standard TV** | 2 points |
| **High Stakes Match** | 4 points |
| **Epic Main Event** | 6+ points |
| **Spotfest** | 5+ points (expensive for what it is) |
| **Comedy Segment** | -2 points (restores energy) |

**Budget:** ~20 points per show before burnout. Plan accordingly.

**Warning:** Spotfests drain heavily but don't create lasting memory, making them poor value.

## SHOW STRUCTURE TYPES (DNA Presets)

| Structure | Description | Common In | Burnout Risk |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Slow Burn Classic** | Gradual escalation in intensity and stakes | NJPW, AJPW 1990s | Low (if executed well) |
| **TV Pop Format** | Strong opener, varied middle, marquee main | AEW, modern TV | Medium (depends on pacing) |
| **Old School House Show** | Main event before intermission (stars leave early) | Territory era | Low (crowd gets what they paid for) |
| **Clusterfuck Chaos** | No build, hot matches scattered randomly | PWG 2014-2019, modern indies | **Very High** |
| **Crescendo Show** | Multiple emotional peaks with breaks between | Big 4 PPVs | Medium (requires skilled pacing) |
| **Bait & Burn** | Starts hot (MOTN opener), never recovers | Modern shows misusing Ospreay openers | **High** |

**Key Insight:** Structure type sets crowd expectations. Breaking the pattern can be brilliant (surprise) or disastrous (confusion).

## CROWD ENERGY & STAMINA SYSTEM

### Crowd Has:

- **Energy Meter** (current excitement level, 0-100)
- **Stamina Bar** (capacity to care, 0-100)
- **Emotion Tracking** (hope, rage, joy, despair, etc.)

### Match/Segment Impact:

**Energy:** Can spike (big spot, surprise) or drop (boring match, overlong segment)  
**Stamina Drain:** High-drama matches, emotional investment, spotfests all drain capacity to care

### Critical Thresholds:

| Stamina Level | Crowd State | Effect |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| **80-100** | Fresh, Engaged | Reacts strongly to everything |
| **60-79** | Invested | Reacts to quality moments |
| **40-59** | Fatigued | Only big spots get reaction |
| **20-39** | Burned Out | Spots over wrestlers, short memory |
| **0-19** | Dead/Hostile | Actively rejects content, chants unrelated stuff |

### Stamina Drain Examples:

- **5-star classic (25 min):** -15 stamina
- **Spotfest (15 min):** -20 stamina (exhausting)
- **Emotional storyline payoff:** -25 stamina (cathartic but draining)
- **Squash (3 min):** -5 stamina
- **Comedy segment (10 min):** +10 stamina (recovery)
- **Boring midcard match:** -5 stamina, -10 energy

## MATCH EMOTIONAL TAGS

Every match/segment carries emotional intent. Too many of same type = burnout.

| Tag | Description | Crowd Effect | Stamina Drain |
|-----|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Courage** | Underdog pushing past limits, physical sacrifice | Hopeful energy boost | Medium |
| **Betrayal** | Turns, screwjobs, walkouts, cheating | Shock and anger spike | High |
| **Humiliation** | Wrestler made to look weak/foolish | Uncomfortable tension | Medium |
| **Redemption** | Comeback, finally achieving goal | Emotional payoff peak | High (cathartic) |
| **Catharsis** | Raw release after extended buildup | Crowd-wide emotional reset | Very High |
| **Nihilism** | No one wins, bleak endings, overkill violence | Emotional numbing | Very High (dangerous) |
| **Chaos** | Ref bumps, run-ins, no structure | Wild pop, short memory | Medium-High |
| **Despair** | Good character wrecked or abandoned | Quiet heaviness | High |
| **Joy** | Unexpected win, lovable goofball antics | Heartwarmers | Low (refreshing) |
| **Panic** | Losing control, shootfight vibes, blood | Edge-of-seat anxiety | High |
| **Bittersweet** | Win comes with cost (injury, betrayal, goodbye) | Crowd splits emotionally | Medium-High |
| **Spite** | Match driven by hatred or ego | Volatile | Medium |
| **Theatrics** | Over-the-top spectacle or pageantry | Works best in moderation | Medium |
| **Spectacle** | Wild spots, big visuals | Burns stamina fast | High |
| **Intimacy** | Personal, stripped-down match | Emotional depth, quiet crowd, high memory | Low-Medium |
| **Ritual** | Sacred tradition (Mask vs. Hair, Budokan farewell) | Reverence, almost ceremonial | Medium (special) |
| **Glory** | Legacy matches, retirements, coronations | Elevates entire show if spaced right | High |
| **Futility** | Crushing losses with no upward path | Muted fans, long memory | High |
| **Tension** | Unresolved feud, no catharsis, ambiguous end | Builds next show | Low-Medium |
| **Release Valve** | Comedy or squash after emotional peak | Crowd cooldown buffer | Negative (restores stamina) |
| **Burnout Bait** | Designed to pop crowd but leaves no memory | Dangerous if repeated | High, no memory gain |
| **Domination** | Overwhelming power display, never in doubt (Vader squash) | Stunned, intimidated respect | Low (brief) but lasting impact |

## EMOTIONAL PALETTE BALANCING

### Healthy Show Example:

1. **Joy** (comedy opener) → Energy up, stamina preserved
2. **Courage** (underdog midcard) → Emotional investment
3. **Release Valve** (quick squash) → Stamina recovery
4. **Spite** (heated grudge match) → High energy
5. **Intimacy** (cool-down technical match) → Deep engagement, low drain
6. **Betrayal** (shocking turn) → Huge spike
7. **Catharsis** (main event payoff) → Show-defining moment

**Result:** Varied emotional palette, strategic cool-downs, memorable peaks

### Unhealthy Show Example (PWG 2014-2019 Problem):

1. **Spectacle** (spotfest opener) → High drain
2. **Spectacle** (spotfest match 2) → More drain
3. **Chaos** (spotfest match 3) → Burnout begins
4. **Spectacle** (spotfest match 4) → Crowd numb
5. **Burnout Bait** (more spots) → Moves over, not wrestlers
6. **Spectacle** (main event spotfest) → No memory retention

**Result:** Crowd burned out by match 4, spots pop but no sustained heat, nothing remembered

---

## BURNOUT TRIGGERS

| Trigger | Effect | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Back-to-back MOTY attempts** | Desensitization, only one remembered | Space peak matches, use cool-downs |
| **No low-stakes matches** | Crowd dies mid-show | Add squashes, comedy, or simple matches |
| **Too many emotional segments** | Drains emotional stamina, later moments hit soft | Balance heavy with light |
| **No cool-downs** | Even great matches blend into white noise | Strategic palate cleansers |
| **Misaligned opener** | Throws off rhythm (TV pop opener in slow burn show) | Match opener to show DNA |
| **Constant spotfests** | Moves get over, not people; crowd burns out fast | Mix in psychology, selling, storytelling |
| **Emotional oversaturation** | 3 betrayals + blood + screwjob = too much weight | Vary emotional tags |

## POST-SHOW EMOTIONAL FLOW ANALYSIS

After each show, system generates breakdown:

### Categories Scored (🟩 Good / 🟨 Warning / 🟥 Problem):

| Category | Evaluates |
|----------|-----------|
| **Emotional Build Logic** | Did pacing make emotional sense? |
| **Burnout Risk** | Was crowd exhausted mid-way? |
| **Card Escalation** | Did matches properly climb in stakes/importance? |
| **Emotional Palette Variety** | Did show overuse one emotion (all tragedy, all chaos)? |
| **Peak Memory Anchors** | How many moments will stick long-term? |
| **Stamina Management** | Were cool-downs used effectively? |
| **Structure Consistency** | Did show follow its DNA preset or confuse crowd? |

### Example Warnings:

- 🟥 "Crowd burned out after Match 4, remaining matches underperformed"
- 🟨 "3 Betrayal tags in first hour, emotional oversaturation risk"
- 🟩 "Peak moments spaced well, 2-3 matches will be remembered"
- 🟥 "No Release Valve segments, crowd fatigue at 85% by main event"

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SYSTEMS

### Crowd Memory:

- High stamina moments = better long-term memory retention
- Burned-out moments = forgotten faster, even if quality was high
- Peak emotional tags create "memory anchors" for callbacks

### Worker Morale:

- Great match that flops due to bad placement = worker frustration
- Booked in wrong emotional slot = "wasted opportunity" resentment

### Venue Logic:

- Smaller venues = more intimate, can sustain emotional depth longer
- Larger arenas = need more spectacle, higher burnout risk

### Match Engine:

- Match quality calculation includes "crowd stamina modifier"
- Same 4.5-star match gets lower rating if crowd is burned out

### AI Booker Philosophies (Phase 5):

- Gedo style: Slow Burn Classic, patient escalation
- Vince Russo: Clusterfuck Chaos, constant swerves
- Baba style: Ritual and Glory emphasis
- Modern indie: High Spectacle risk

---

## STRATEGIC PACING TOOLS

### Cool-Down Matches:

- **Squash** (3-5 min) → Quick, low-drain, protects star
- **Comedy** (5-10 min) → Restores stamina, mood lifter
- **Technical Showcase** (10-15 min) → Intimacy tag, deep but low-drain
- **Promo Segment** (5 min) → Advances story without physical drain

### Energy Spikes:

- **Surprise Return** → Instant energy +30
- **Shocking Turn** → Energy +25, stamina -20
- **Title Change** → Energy +40, stamina -25

### Strategic Intermissions:

- 2-3 hour shows benefit from 10-15 min intermission
- Allows stamina partial recovery (+20-30)
- Resets energy baseline
- Old-school house shows: main event before intermission (stars leave)

---
