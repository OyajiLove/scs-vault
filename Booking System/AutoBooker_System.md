# AutoBooker System

📛 **NAME:** AutoBooker System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Booking System / AI Behavior  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** autobooker, AI, booking, simulation, shows, cards, matches, free sim, hands-off  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Context-sensitive, emotionally reactive, memory-shaped booking simulation. Every promotion has an AutoBooker Brain that books shows according to promotion identity, booker archetype, locker room chemistry, title myths, fan appetite, and worker resistance. It's not random. It's not balanced. It's how the fed would book.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Reads 9 inputs before booking any show
- Booking logic covers main events, card flow, feuds, titles, finishes, psychology
- Self-corrects based on crowd memory, backlash, and success/failure
- 4 player modes: Light Touch, Mentorship, Override, Free Sim
- Integrates with all major SCS systems

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Very High (LLM can explain booking decisions, generate show narratives, describe why certain matches were booked)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 1103-1110

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Worker_Resistance_System]] - weighs morale, reputation, pushback risk
- [[Fan_Memory_Drift]] - booking affects crowd reaction
- [[Match_Flavor_Matrix]] - avoids flavor overload
- [[Worker_Tags]] - tags skew outcomes, pacing, finishes
- [[Feud_Memory_Tracker]] - callbacks, escalations, fizzles
- [[Booker_Archetypes]] - all logic tied to archetype
- [[Booking_Instinct_Stat]] - affects upset vs protection decisions
- [[Stable_Faction_System]] - clique influence on booking

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact algorithms for match selection
- How "accidentally booking classics" works mechanically

## Version History

| Version | Source | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 1.0 | Vol 5 | 🔒 LOCKED |

## Core Concept

Every promotion in the world (AI or player-controlled) has access to an **AutoBooker Brain**, which books shows in accordance with:
- Promotion identity & history
- Booker archetype + skill
- Locker room chemistry
- Title myths & emotional escalation
- Fan appetite & burnout
- Worker resistance, clique politics, and memory drift

**It's not random. It's not balanced. It's how the fed would book.**

## Inputs: What the AutoBooker Reads Before Booking ✅ LOCKED

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Promotion Soul** | Determines which match types, feud styles, and finishes are prioritized. Deathmatch soul = less roll-ups, more blood. |
| **Booker Archetype** | Shapes feud structure, arc length, betrayal pacing, title switches, and match tone. |
| **Worker Availability** | Reads injuries, tours, resistance, contract status, and hidden morale tags. |
| **Fan Reaction Memory** | Reads past crowd pops, push backlash, and arc heat. Adjusts cards to match recent world behavior. |
| **Title Prestige & Myth Memory** | Books matches to protect or elevate titles based on fan belief in the belt. |
| **Match Flavor Loadout** | Respects the match flavor logic and avoids overloading fans with the same tone repeatedly. |
| **Feud Arcs** | Continues, escalates, or cools down feuds based on emotional burn. Takes into account injury and crowd sentiment. |
| **Show Pacing Memory** | Knows recent crowd fatigue. Adjusts cooldown vs bomb balance. |
| **Stable/Clique Influence** | Powerful backstage groups (e.g., Kliq) skew match structure, finishes, and push logic. |

## Booking Logic: How It Chooses Matches ✅ LOCKED

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Main Event Logic** | Chooses based on title stakes, feud heat, worker booking memory, promotion soul, booker archetype risk tolerance |
| **Card Flow** | Avoids stacking similar match flavor or tempo. Mixes: sprint opener, tag workrate, midcard story match, blood feud, cooldown comedy, big epic |
| **Feud Placement** | Heat Seeker bookers push hot matches too fast. Architects slow burn. Reactionaries shuffle everything after a crowd dip. |
| **Title Booking** | Belts are booked either to escalate arc drama, protect mystique, pop a crowd (Trend Rider), or kill heat deliberately (Survivor logic) |
| **Match Finish Selection** | Tied to fan drift, soul alignment, worker resistance, cultural tone, gimmick compatibility |
| **Worker Psychology** | Will avoid matches that trigger known resistance or morale collapse unless booking sabotage is intentional |
| **Upsets vs Protection** | Controlled by Booking Instinct stat + Promotion Philosophy. High-instinct AI might build a protected loss. Low-instinct might bury a hot worker and not realize what they did. |

## Tournament & Big Show Booking ✅ LOCKED

When booking tournaments, G1-style blocks, or multi-day arcs:

- Respects fatigue
- Tracks emotional rise and fall
- Will "accidentally" book classics sometimes
- May bury the final match if the story arc peaked too early (bad bookers do this often)

**Adds:**
- Emotional match ratings
- Crowd shock vs satisfaction tracking
- May accidentally build legendary matches through smart worker memory alignment

---

## Memory & Self-Correction ✅ LOCKED

AutoBooker learns from:
- Crowd pop memory
- Fan backlash
- Worker resistance fallout
- Title decay
- Booking success/failure in prior arcs

**Archetype-Based Reactions:**
| Archetype | Self-Correction Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Fan Chaser, Politicker** | Will overcorrect based on recent feedback |
| **Despot, Idealist** | May keep pushing into the storm despite failure |

**Adds volatility. And lets feuds crash and burn believably.**

## Player Options: Tuning the AutoBooker ✅ LOCKED

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Light Touch Mode** | Player picks main events and key arcs. AutoBooker handles undercard. |
| **Mentorship Mode** | Player takes control of a lower fed. Learns from how AI books in the big leagues. |
| **Override Mode** | Player can veto or rebook specific matches, workers, or finishes. |
| **Free Sim Mode** | Full AI booking across the world. Hands-off storytelling chaos. |

---

## World Integration: Ties to Previous Systems ✅ LOCKED

| Legacy System | Connection |
|---------------|------------|
| **Worker Resistance** | AutoBooker must weigh morale, reputation, and risk of pushback. Resistance modifies matches, angles, even show cancellations. |
| **Fan Memory & Drift** | Booking too many flat arcs? Crowd tunes out. Booking same flavor every show? Soul drift begins. |
| **Match Flavor Matrix (Vol. 4)** | Booked matches must vary. Match flavor overload = burnout. Underdelivering = push backlash. |
| **Worker Tags (Vol. 2)** | Tags like "Show Stealer," "Booking Politician," "Morale Killer" skew match outcomes, arc pacing, and finish choice. |
| **Feud Logic (Vol. 3)** | Will book callbacks, betrayals, escalations, or fizzles depending on feud structure, betrayal memory, and emotional peak timing. |
| **Archetypes (Vol. 5)** | All booking logic tied to Booker and Promoter archetype synergy. Architects won't hotshot. Heat Seekers burn bright, then burn down. |
| **Scouting Tags** | Some bookers overuse certain archetypes (e.g., pushing "Next Big Things" even when chemistry fails). |
| **Commentary Systems** | AutoBooker performance shapes how commentary frames booking trends (e.g., "Why does every show end in DQ lately?") |

## Philosophy

> "The SCS AutoBooker System is not just a match generator. It's a context-sensitive, emotionally reactive, memory-shaped booking simulation. It creates great shows, collapsed pushes, feuds that overheat, betrayals that feel earned, worker burnout arcs, title myth collapse or resurrection, and booking reputations that stick and drift."

## Connected Mechanics

- [[Worker_Resistance_System]] - morale, pushback
- [[Fan_Memory_Drift]] - crowd reaction
- [[Match_Flavor_Matrix]] - variety
- [[Feud_Memory_Tracker]] - arc management
- [[Booker_Archetypes]] - booking personality
- [[Booking_Instinct_Stat]] - quality of decisions

## Partial Card Recognition (Vol 5 lines 1114-1118) ✅ LOCKED

When a user books part of a show and hits "Fill in the Rest", the AutoBooker:

| Step | Logic |
|------|-------|
| **1. Scan Prebooked Segments** | Pull match flavor, emotional tone, segment type, pacing, placement |
| **2. Identify Gaps** | Read segment count and structure from show metadata (not static setting) |
| **3. Emotional Flow Sync** | Use prebooked pieces to shape rhythm (hot opener → cooldown, shoot promo → structured reset) |
| **4. Booking Tone Reference** | Pull from Promotion Style DNA ("Classic AJPW?" avoid wacky comedy. "DDT chaos?" get absurd.) |
| **5. Feud Continuation & Title Tracking** | Ensure feuds escalate but don't climax unless told. TV Title toggle triggers defense slots. |
| **6. Fan & Worker Memory** | Avoid hot workers in squash filler, burnt-out match flavors, stale arcs, resistance risks |

### Example

**User books:**
- Main: Omega vs Moxley
- Midcard: Ospreay shoots on Okada

**AutoBooker returns:**
- Opener: 6-man junior tag (pop crowd + showcase speed)
- Second: Squash for rising heel
- Cooldown: Backstage segment teasing redemption arc for injured ace
- Pre-main: High-stakes tag previewing upcoming faction war

Each segment respects show pacing, reflects style DNA, adjusts for crowd burnout using stored emotional flow.

## AI Booker Integration (Vol 5 lines 1119-1121) ✅ LOCKED

When an AI-controlled promotion uses AutoBooker, it's not just spitting out cards. It's expressing the vision of the AI booker archetype + their personal skills and flaws.

**Every AI Booked Promotion = A Personality Booking It**

AutoBooker becomes execution system for the booker's mind, which includes:
- Archetype (Heat Seeker, Architect, Politicker, etc.)
- Booking Instinct rating (0-20)
- Negotiation skill
- Hidden traits (Drive, Ego, Morality, Paranoia)
- Emotional memory (past scandals, walkouts, breakout arcs, betrayals)

### AI Booker Evolving Behavior

AI bookers don't remain static:

| Trigger | Behavior Change |
|---------|-----------------|
| Lose fan trust | Become more desperate or paranoid |
| Get hot feud success | Start overplaying betrayal tropes |
| Worker walkout | Might go scorched earth, or course correct |
| Survive a revolt | May flip archetypes (Architect → Survivor) |
| Drift too far | May get replaced, shift archetypes, or implode the fed |

Their behavior drives the emotional texture of each fed over time.

## Template System (from Vol 3) ✅ LOCKED

Players can create, export, and share templates directly from the game UI with tag sorting:
- Promotion
- Decade
- Style
- Custom tags

AutoBooker output is filtered through these templates based on promotion's style logic.
