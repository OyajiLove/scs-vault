# Booking Memory Pressure System

📛 **NAME:** Booking Memory Pressure System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Booking System / AI Behavior  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** booking, memory, pressure, trust, betrayal, scars, loyalty, AI, bias  
📝 **SUMMARY:** System governing how promotions, bookers, and AI develop emotional booking instincts over time. Past emotional events warp future decisions. Bookers don't use clean "push best worker by stats" logic. They're pressured by world memory, crowd scars, promotion loyalty, worker betrayal scars, fatigue signals, and emotional trust residue.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 6 sources of memory pressure: Past Betrayals, Emotional Scars, Fatigue/Decay, Fanbase Loyalty, Promotion Drift, Worker Cultural Drift
- Practical effects: Title Shot Trust, Booking Hesitation, Forced Redemptions, Emotional Anchor Protection
- AI bookers avoid screwing beloved legends, subtly limit betrayers, recognize climate clashes
- Player feels emotional weight: booking wrong sparks revolt, protecting beloved workers smooths booking

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (LLM can explain booking decisions, generate pressure warnings, narrate trust dynamics)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 909-912

## Core Concept

Promotions, locker rooms, and audiences develop emotional booking instincts over time. Not clean mechanical "push best worker by stats" logic. Past emotional events warp future decisions.

Memory lives inside booking tendencies organically.

## Sources of Booking Memory Pressure ✅ LOCKED

| Memory Type | Booking Influence |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Past Betrayals** | Workers who stabbed companies/fanbases risk booking hesitation, shorter title reigns, early betrayal arcs planned against them |
| **Emotional Scars** | Workers who survived brutal arcs have emotional fan shields. Killing them off poorly creates backlash. |
| **Fatigue/Decay Visibility** | Workers visibly declining physically (without late-career adaptation) risk quiet burial bookings or forced tragic collapse arcs |
| **Fanbase Emotional Loyalty** | Bookers pressured to protect fan-favorite survivors or risk crowd betrayal (AEW Hangman 2021 style pressures) |
| **Promotion Identity Drift** | If the company soul shifts (rebellion era, tragedy era), workers emotionally out of sync with new soul risk faster burial |
| **Worker Cultural Drift** | Workers who become memes or ironic figures (too many sympathy rehashes, old legends clinging on) face passive or active burial |

## Practical Booking Effects Over Time ✅ LOCKED

| Booking Layer | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|
| **Worker Title Shot Trust** | Workers with strong fan emotional loyalty are trusted with longer, later title reigns, even post-physical peak |
| **Booking Hesitation** | Workers with fan fatigue, betrayal scars, or physical visible decay see slower title pushes, more midcard insulation |
| **Forced Redemptions** | Promotions can try to forcibly "rehabilitate" a broken myth. Risk of backlash if emotional timing misreads. |
| **Emotional Anchor Protection** | Workers beloved emotionally but physically decayed may get protected final runs, gentle send-offs, career curtain calls |

The emotional weight of past booking shapes future instincts naturally.

## How AI Bookers Handle Memory Pressure ✅ LOCKED

| Pressure Type | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|
| **High Pressure to Protect Fan Emotional Icons** | AI avoids screwing beloved legends unless deliberate tragic booking arcs planned |
| **High Betrayal Memory Weight** | AI subtly limits betrayers. Books betrayals against them faster, keeps them emotionally vulnerable. |
| **Promotion Drift Awareness** | AI smart enough to recognize if old stalwarts clash with new rebellion/nostalgia/tragedy climates. Books transitions emotionally if possible. |

Not mechanical "popularity" stat booking. True emotional instinct booking.

## Player Experience of Booking Memory Pressure

As a player, you will feel the emotional weight:
- Booking certain workers "wrong" will spark subtle or overt fan revolt
- Protecting emotionally beloved workers properly will make booking easier, smoother, more emotionally resonant
- Trying to push emotionally broken myths will risk hurting your show's loyalty trajectory, not just tanking one event

**Booking memory becomes an emotional survival game, not just a "ratings chase."**

## Philosophy

> "In SCS, Booking Memory Pressure lives inside every decision. Promotions, bookers, fans, workers all carry emotional scars and loyalty drift, and booking reacts to it naturally. Past emotional arcs warp future emotional booking instincts, not just stats. True wrestling soul: hard, messy, human."
