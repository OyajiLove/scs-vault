# Push System

📛 **NAME:** Push System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Booking System / Career System  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** push, momentum, elevation, backlash, breakout, tier, main event, midcard, overpush  
📝 **SUMMARY:** A push is not just screen time. It's memory. It's belief. It's emotional trajectory. SCS tracks pushes as living arcs through 6 layers: booking memory, fan reaction, title proximity, arc coherence, commentary echo, and locker room perception. Pushes leave behind legacy tags that affect future booking.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 6 tracking layers determine push perception
- 6 push types (Classic Rise, Redemption, Crash, Token, Faction, Heir)
- 9 public-facing push tiers (Spot Opener to Myth-Tier)
- 9 internal emotional states (Hopeful to Iconic)
- 5 push memory tags for legacy effects

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Very High (LLM can narrate push arcs, describe fan perception shifts, generate commentary about push success/failure)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 1169-1181

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Buzz_System]] - momentum affects push speed
- [[Fan_Reaction_Memory]] - tracks crowd buy-in
- [[Booking_Memory_Pressure_System]] - past booking affects push credibility
- [[Worker_Resistance_System]] - overpush triggers resistance
- [[AutoBooker_System]] - Booking Instinct affects push timing
- [[Commentary_System]] - echoes push narrative
- [[Draft_System]] - draft position creates push expectations

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact thresholds for tier transitions
- How long before "Crowd Rejected" can reset
- Push interference from backstage politics

## Core Concept

> "A push is not just screen time. It's memory. It's belief. It's emotional trajectory."

SCS tracks pushes as living arcs, not stats, not rankings, but narrative weight.

A push is a **world-recognized effort to elevate a worker.**

## 6 Tracking Layers ✅ LOCKED

| Layer | Tracked Through |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Booking Memory** | Who they beat, how often they're featured, what segments they're trusted with |
| **Fan Reaction Memory** | Are crowds buying in? Are pops growing or fading? Is heat earned or forced? |
| **Title Proximity & Match Stakes** | Not just "did they win the belt," but were they near it, chasing it, or used to elevate it? |
| **Emotional Arc Coherence** | Does it feel like a story, or just appearances? Was there payoff? |
| **Commentary & Media Echo** | Did the narrative catch on? Are analysts treating it as real? Or mock-worthy? |
| **Locker Room Perception** | "This guy's getting the rocket." Or: "Another flavor of the week." Resistance, politics, and sabotage emerge from how the push is perceived internally. |

## 6 Push Types ✅ LOCKED

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Classic Rise** | Wins, builds crowd momentum, gets signature moments, peaks at the right time |
| **Redemption Push** | Comeback arc: injury return, post-burial surge, veteran reinvention |
| **Crash Push** | Fast-track star whose heat outpaces belief. Often ends in backlash. |
| **Token Push** | Perceived as shallow: checking a box, pleasing a sponsor, or responding to backlash |
| **Faction Push** | Group association elevates someone. Risk: may vanish if faction collapses. |
| **Heir Push** | "The chosen one" story. Can work... or burn the fed down. |

---

## Push Tiers (Public-Facing, Option A) ✅ LOCKED

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Spot Opener** | Used to spark the crowd. Often high energy, low consequence. |
| **Undercard Fixture** | Consistent presence. Rarely pushed. Crowd knows the role. |
| **Climber** | Actively being elevated. Wins, buzz, early feud escalation. |
| **Gatekeeper** | Trusted test. Credible, respected, but rarely wins the big one. |
| **Hot Prospect** | Youthful, buzzy, crowd-reactive, but still raw. |
| **Upper Midcard Pillar** | Featured often, but not quite "the one." |
| **Main Eventer** | Booked as a top star, anchor of title stories or long arcs. |
| **Myth-Tier** | Crowd believes they're special. Even losses don't kill aura. |
| **Overexposed / Drifting** | Once hot, now cooling. Fans feel the push dragging. |

---

## Internal Emotional States (Option B, Under the Hood) ✅ LOCKED

Used internally to drive fan reaction, backlash risk, push success, and commentary behavior:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Hopeful** | Crowd is rooting for them. Arc feels right. |
| **Pretender** | Getting pushed, but not believed. Crowd disconnect. |
| **Survivor** | Hanging on. Not hot, but trusted. Useful. |
| **Cursed** | Booked poorly for too long. Pushes don't land anymore. |
| **Rocketed** | Sudden elevation. Can be breakout or backlash bait. |
| **Ascendant** | Momentum + trust + story = crowd believes. |
| **Stalled** | Was climbing. Now stuck. Booking unsure. Fans hesitant. |
| **Cemented** | Emotionally confirmed as "real." No more proving needed. |
| **Iconic / Mythbound** | Even if retired, fans treat them like gods. |

**Hybrid Approach:** Option A public-facing for usability. Option B tracks internal logic.

## Push Memory Tags ✅ LOCKED

Pushes leave behind legacy tags:

| Tag | Result |
|-----|--------|
| **Push Backlash** | Slows future booking momentum unless memory is reset |
| **Fan Forgiven** | Arc completed, failure owned, crowd is open again |
| **Crowd Rejected** | No pop sticks. Commentary wary. Booker hesitates. |
| **Breakout Success** | Push remembered as earned. Worker now seen as credible in main events. |
| **Flop Myth** | Push failure became legendary. "They're doing a repeat of the X run." |

---

## System Integration ✅ LOCKED

| System | Push Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| **Worker Resistance (Vol. 5)** | Overpushed workers may refuse to lose. Undervalued ones may check out. |
| **Booking Memory (Vol. 2-3)** | A bad push isn't just forgotten. It reshapes how workers are booked, how feuds are paced. |
| **Fan Reaction Memory** | Pushes track crowd shift over time, even slow drifts ("we stopped caring around February"). |
| **AutoBooker** | High Instinct bookers time push arcs well. Low Instincts botch them. Commentary and world call them out. |
| **Scouting Tags** | "Next Big Thing" or "Late Bloomer" tags affect push success probability and how feds frame the story. |
| **Draft Fallout** | High draft pick fails = backfire. Late pick hits = "push deserved, finally." Draft memory reshapes future angles. |
| **Commentary System** | "They've tried this push before..." or "This is different. You can feel it." Voice of the world. |
| **Buzz System** | Buzz affects how fast a "Climber" becomes "Ascendant," or whether a "Rocketed" push crashes. |

---

## Philosophy

> "A push in SCS is not a binary flag. It's a living narrative trajectory. Pushes are tracked through memory, fan emotion, booking rhythm, and worker psychology. They leave behind scar tissue, breakout momentum, or redemption arcs. The world remembers the attempt."
