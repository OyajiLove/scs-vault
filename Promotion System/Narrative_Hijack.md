# Narrative Hijack Systems

📛 **NAME:** Narrative Hijack Systems  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Promotion System / Identity Control  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** hijack, narrative, identity, rewrite, retcon, faction, victory, history  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models what happens when one faction wins a Cultural Civil War and takes control of a promotion's emotional identity. Winning factions rewrite branding, booking, history, and worker pushes. Losing fans either adapt or drift away. Future generations inherit the new identity unless hardcore cults preserve the old ways.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 4 win scenarios (Traditionalists, Innovators, Corporate Survivalists, Anarchists)
- Winners rewrite promotion identity through branding, booking, historical retconning
- Fanbase either adapts or exoduses
- Worker pushes shift to align with winning faction
- World memory drifts to new identity unless preservation movements resist

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Moderate (LLM could generate rebranding narratives, retconned documentaries, HOF speeches, marketing materials)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 445-447 (locked)

## 1. WIN SCENARIOS (4 OUTCOMES)

| Scenario | Description | Long-Term Effect |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Traditionalists Win** | Promotion doubles down on founding emotional spirit: prestige, pure storytelling, emotional realism | Stability, core fans satisfied, but risks stagnation if no evolution |
| **Innovators Win** | Promotion redefines emotional core: new booking philosophy, new demographic targeting, new in-ring style | Fresh energy, but alienated core fans may never return |
| **Corporate Survivalists Win** | Promotion mutes conflict by corporate compromise: safer but emotionally hollow outcomes | Stable but bland, neither side fully satisfied |
| **Anarchists Win** | Promotion mutates into chaos, irony, crash TV: unstable emotionally but explosive short-term | Hot streaks followed by burnout, long-term sustainability questionable |

## 2. HOW WINNING FACTION HIJACKS NARRATIVE

| Mechanic | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Promotion Identity Rewrite** | Branding, booking style, promotional tone re-align with winning faction's emotional DNA |
| **Fanbase Adaptation or Exodus** | Some fans emotionally adapt over time; others drift away embittered or nostalgic for lost eras |
| **Historical Retconning** | Winning faction rewrites company history through documentaries, commentary, Hall of Fame inclusions, marketing materials |
| **Worker Push Shifts** | Workers aligned with winning faction rise; others fade, defect, or become symbols of "lost eras" |
| **World Memory Shift** | Future generations inherit the new emotional identity unless hardcore memory cults preserve the old ways |

---

## 3. RETCONNING MECHANICS

| Retcon Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Era Minimization** | Downplay or ignore previous eras that don't fit new identity | WWE minimizing Attitude Era's worst excesses in documentaries |
| **Hero Reframing** | Recast old stars as fitting new narrative, or quietly phase them out | Attitude Era stars reframed as "family entertainment pioneers" |
| **Villain Creation** | Cast old leaders or philosophies as mistakes or villains | Inokiism era cast as "dark period" in NJPW restoration narrative |
| **Selective Celebration** | Cherry-pick moments that support new identity | Only showing Austin beer baths, not Lawler slurs |
| **HOF as Narrative Tool** | Hall of Fame inductions signal what the promotion values now | Inducting sanitized versions of controversial figures |

---

## 4. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Event | Narrative Hijack Outcome |
|-------|--------------------------|
| **WWF Post-Attitude Era** | Corporate PG survivalists won. Rewrote history to idolize "family entertainment" and downplay Attitude chaos. Selective nostalgia for safe moments. |
| **NJPW Post-Inokiism (Post-2005)** | Traditionalists (true pro wrestling) slowly retook emotional identity through Tanahashi/Okada eras. Bitter revisionism of Inokiism period. |
| **AEW (TBD)** | If Emotional Storytelling Wave wins, AEW may become emotionally-driven realism federation. If Elite/Crash TV side wins, faction-based chaos becomes core identity. |

### WWF Post-Attitude Case Study

**Civil War:** Attitude Era chaos vs Corporate PG future

**Winner:** Corporate Survivalists (Vince's corporate vision)

**Hijack Mechanics:**
- Branding: From "WWF Attitude" to "WWE Universe" family brand
- Retconning: Attitude Era selectively celebrated (beer baths, catchphrases) while worst excesses buried
- Worker Pushes: Attitude stars repackaged or phased out; new "PG-friendly" stars elevated
- HOF: Attitude figures inducted with sanitized presentations
- Fan Exodus: Hardcore Attitude fans drifted to ROH, NJPW, indies; new family audience replaced them

**Memory Outcome:** Mainstream remembers Attitude as "fun rebellion," not racism/sexism. Hardcore preserves full complexity.

## 5. FANBASE RESPONSE TO HIJACK

| Response | Description | Likelihood |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Full Adaptation** | Fans embrace new identity completely | 20-30% (usually new fans) |
| **Grudging Acceptance** | Fans stay but feel nostalgic for old days | 30-40% |
| **Bitter Loyalty** | Fans stay but constantly complain | 15-25% |
| **Emotional Exodus** | Fans leave for competitors or alternatives | 15-30% |
| **Cult Preservation** | Fans stay but form preservation movements for old identity | 5-10% |

## 7. PHILOSOPHY

> "Whoever wins the war writes the history. In wrestling, that means whoever controls the booking, controls the documentaries, controls the Hall of Fame, controls what fans remember, and controls what they forget. The old identity doesn't die immediately: it fades, rewritten out of existence until only the devoted remember."

Narrative Hijack is not inherently evil: sometimes new identities are genuinely better. But it always involves loss: the old identity, the old fans, the old heroes who don't fit the new story.
