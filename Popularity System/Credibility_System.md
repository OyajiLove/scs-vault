# CREDIBILITY SYSTEM

📛 **NAME:** Credibility System (Third Axis)  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Worker Perception, Match Stakes & Threat Level  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** credibility, believability, threat level, fan trust, can they win  
📝 **SUMMARY:**

Credibility is the third perception axis alongside Buzz and Popularity. It tracks whether fans believe a worker can actually WIN matches, particularly against top-tier opponents. A worker can be popular and buzzing but lack credibility (comedy babyface), or have high credibility with modest popularity (no-nonsense midcarder).

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Credibility = Do fans believe this worker can beat top talent, win titles, or headline shows?
- Separate from Buzz (short-term noise) and Popularity (long-term draw)
- Built through: Strong booking logic, close losses to big stars, visible skill growth, emotional storytelling, smart promo reinforcement
- Damaged by: 50/50 parity booking, unearned pushes, repeated failed title shots, match layout predictability
- Determines whether Buzz actually translates into Popularity, and whether pops = belief or just noise

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal. Formula-driven tracking, LLM may assist narrative framing.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol. 2 Chunk 10 (terminology lock: renamed from "Heat" to avoid wrestling terminology confusion)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** [[Popularity_System]], [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz System]], [[Booking_Engine_P1-3]], [[Predictability_Stakes]]

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**

- Exact formula for credibility growth/decay
- How quickly does 50/50 booking erode credibility?
- Can credibility be rebuilt after severe damage, or is there a basement?

## THE THREE AXES OF WORKER PERCEPTION

| Axis | What It Measures | Volatility | Example |
|------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| **Buzz** | Short-term excitement, noise, talk | HIGH (weekly) | "Everyone's talking about them this week" |
| **Popularity** | Long-term fan connection, drawing power | LOW (months/years) | "Fans will pay to see them" |
| **Credibility** | Threat level, believability as winner | MEDIUM | "Fans believe they could actually win" |

## WHY CREDIBILITY MATTERS

**The Problem Without Credibility:**
- A goofy comedy babyface can be super popular, buzzing like crazy, but have NO credibility in a title match
- Fans pop for their entrances but don't believe they'll win the big one
- This affects match drama, stakes, and payoff satisfaction

**The Solution:**
- Credibility as a third axis lets the system track threat perception separately
- Match types weight credibility differently:
  - Comedy match? Popularity rules
  - Grudge match? Buzz + Credibility
  - Title match? Credibility matters MOST

## CREDIBILITY SOURCES

| Source | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Strong booking logic | +Credibility |
| Close losses to established stars | +Credibility (if sold as competitive) |
| Visible skill growth | +Credibility |
| Emotional storytelling | +Credibility (if believable) |
| Smart promo reinforcement | +Credibility |
| 50/50 parity booking | -Credibility |
| Unearned pushes | -Credibility |
| Repeated failed title shots | -Credibility |
| Predictable match layouts | -Credibility |

## CASE STUDY: Tommy Rich vs Abdullah (Ole Anderson Build)

| Booking | System Interpretation |
|---------|----------------------|
| Repeated losses with visible growth | +Credibility, +Fan Trust (fans sense a future) |
| Gradual buzz from near wins | +Buzz week-to-week if storytelling remains coherent |
| Final win feels earned | Huge +Popularity, cemented fan loyalty, locked into crowd memory |
| If spammed without growth | Buzz dies, Credibility drops, becomes noise not narrative |

**Key Insight:** Promotions that carefully evolve arcs reap exponential payoff. Promotions that loop endlessly get punished by fan detachment and cynicism.

## CREDIBILITY BY WORKER TYPE

| Worker Type | Typical Credibility | Notes |
|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| Main Event Ace | 80-100 | Protected, rarely loses clean |
| Upper Midcard | 60-79 | Occasional upsets, threat in tournaments |
| Midcard | 40-59 | Can pull off surprise victories |
| Comedy Worker | 10-39 | High pop possible, low credibility typical |
| Underdog Babyface | Variable | Built through losses, spikes on upset wins |
| Monster Heel | 70-90 | High threat level until defeated |
