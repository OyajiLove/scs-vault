# Push System

📛 **NAME:** Push System (Star-Making Dynamics)  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Booking System / Career System  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** push, momentum, elevation, backlash, breakout, tier, main event, midcard, overpush, false popularity, manufactured star, make or break, coronation, floundering  
📝 **SUMMARY:** A push is not just screen time. It's memory. It's belief. It's emotional trajectory. SCS tracks pushes as living arcs through 6 layers: booking memory, fan reaction, title proximity, arc coherence, commentary echo, and locker room perception. Pushes leave behind legacy tags that affect future booking. When pushes outpace organic crowd support, the system tracks deterioration through False Popularity → Make or Break → Failed Coronation → Floundering states.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- 6 tracking layers determine push perception
- 6 push types (Classic Rise, Redemption, Crash, Token, Faction, Heir)
- 9 public-facing push tiers (Spot Opener to Myth-Tier)
- 9 internal emotional states (Hopeful to Iconic)
- 5 push memory tags for legacy effects
- Push Level (0-100) tracked against Organic Popularity to detect overpush
- State progression: False Popularity → Make or Break → Failed Coronation → Floundering

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Very High. LLM can narrate push arcs, describe fan perception shifts, generate commentary about push success/failure, suggest recovery paths.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 1169-1181 (core system), Vol 2-3 (push strategies), December 2025 (state progression mechanics from Mike Ferguson feedback)

## Mechanics in This System

### Core Mechanics
- [[Push_Gap]] - The gap between Push Level and Organic Popularity
- [[False_Popularity]] - When crowds reject a manufactured star
- [[Push_Strategies]] - Available push approaches and their risks

### State Progression
- [[Make_or_Break]] - Pivotal matches where crowd decides to accept or reject
- [[Failed_Coronation]] - State after Make or Break failures
- [[Floundering_State]] - Terminal apathy state, only reinvention works

### Recovery
- [[Recovery_Protocols]] - How to recover from failed pushes

## Core Concept

> "A push is not just screen time. It's memory. It's belief. It's emotional trajectory."

SCS tracks pushes as living arcs, not stats, not rankings, but **narrative weight**.

A push is a **world-recognized effort to elevate a worker.**

---

## The Push Lifecycle

```
HEALTHY PUSH
     ↓ (Push Gap ≥ 20 for 4+ weeks)
FALSE POPULARITY
     ↓ (Major event + high stakes)
MAKE OR BREAK MOMENT
     ├→ BREAKTHROUGH → Back to HEALTHY
     ├→ ADEQUATE → Still FALSE POPULARITY
     └→ FAILURE → FAILED CORONATION
                       ↓ (No recovery action OR more failures)
                  FLOUNDERING
                       ↓ (Only exit)
                  COMPLETE REINVENTION
                       or
                  DEPUSH / RELEASE
```

## Push Level Tracking

**Push Level (0-100)** represents how hard the promotion is positioning a worker as a star, independent of whether crowds have bought in.

### Push Level Factors

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Card Position** | High | Main event = high push, opener = low push |
| **Win Percentage** | High | Protected winners vs. 50/50 vs. jobbing |
| **Title Proximity** | High | Champion, challenger, contender, or nowhere near gold |
| **TV/Promo Time** | Medium | Segment length, promo opportunities, spotlight moments |
| **Commentary Treatment** | Medium | "The future of this business" vs. "solid hand" |
| **Merchandise Push** | Medium | Featured on posters, ads, merch displays |
| **Opponent Quality** | Medium | Working with main eventers vs. enhancement talent |
| **Booking Protection** | High | Never loses clean, always looks strong |

### Push Level Scale

| Range | Push Tier | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 90-100 | **Franchise Player** | "The Guy," everything revolves around them |
| 80-89 | **Top Star Push** | Main event lock, heavily protected |
| 70-79 | **Upper Card Push** | Regular main eventer, title program ready |
| 60-69 | **Strong Midcard** | Building toward upper card |
| 50-59 | **Midcard** | Solid positioning, occasional spotlight |
| 40-49 | **Lower Midcard** | Wins sometimes, loses to people above |
| 30-39 | **Enhancement Plus** | Occasionally wins, mostly builds others |
| 20-29 | **Jobber** | Exists to lose |
| 0-19 | **Invisible** | Barely on TV, no investment |

## 6 Tracking Layers ✅ LOCKED

| Layer | Tracked Through |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Booking Memory** | Who they beat, how often they're featured, what segments they're trusted with |
| **Fan Reaction Memory** | Are crowds buying in? Are pops growing or fading? Is heat earned or forced? |
| **Title Proximity & Match Stakes** | Not just "did they win the belt," but were they near it, chasing it, or used to elevate it? |
| **Emotional Arc Coherence** | Does it feel like a story, or just appearances? Was there payoff? |
| **Commentary & Media Echo** | Did the narrative catch on? Are analysts treating it as real? Or mock-worthy? |
| **Locker Room Perception** | "This guy's getting the rocket." Or: "Another flavor of the week." Resistance, politics, and sabotage emerge from how the push is perceived internally. |

---

## 6 Push Types ✅ LOCKED

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Classic Rise** | Wins, builds crowd momentum, gets signature moments, peaks at the right time |
| **Redemption Push** | Comeback arc: injury return, post-burial surge, veteran reinvention |
| **Crash Push** | Fast-track star whose heat outpaces belief. Often ends in backlash. |
| **Token Push** | Perceived as shallow: checking a box, pleasing a sponsor, or responding to backlash |
| **Faction Push** | Group association elevates someone. Risk: may vanish if faction collapses. |
| **Heir Push** | "The chosen one" story. Can work... or burn the fed down. |

---

## Push Tiers (Public-Facing) ✅ LOCKED

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Spot Opener** | Used to spark the crowd. Often high energy, low consequence. |
| **Undercard Fixture** | Consistent presence. Rarely pushed. Crowd knows the role. |
| **Climber** | Actively being elevated. Wins, buzz, early feud escalation. |
| **Gatekeeper** | Trusted test. Credible, respected, but rarely wins the big one. |
| **Hot Prospect** | Youthful, buzzy, crowd-reactive, but still raw. |
| **Upper Midcard Pillar** | Featured often, but not quite "the one." |
| **Main Eventer** | Booked as a top star, anchor of title stories or long arcs. |
| **Myth-Tier** | Crowd believes they're special. Even losses don't kill aura. |
| **Overexposed / Drifting** | Once hot, now cooling. Fans feel the push dragging. |

---

## Internal Emotional States ✅ LOCKED

Used internally to drive fan reaction, backlash risk, push success, and commentary behavior:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Hopeful** | Crowd is rooting for them. Arc feels right. |
| **Pretender** | Getting pushed, but not believed. Crowd disconnect. |
| **Survivor** | Hanging on. Not hot, but trusted. Useful. |
| **Cursed** | Booked poorly for too long. Pushes don't land anymore. |
| **Rocketed** | Sudden elevation. Can be breakout or backlash bait. |
| **Ascendant** | Momentum + trust + story = crowd believes. |
| **Stalled** | Was climbing. Now stuck. Booking unsure. Fans hesitant. |
| **Cemented** | Emotionally confirmed as "real." No more proving needed. |
| **Iconic / Mythbound** | Even if retired, fans treat them like gods. |

**Hybrid Approach:** Public-facing tiers for usability. Internal emotional states track the logic.

---

## Push Memory Tags ✅ LOCKED

Pushes leave behind legacy tags:

| Tag | Result |
|-----|--------|
| **Push Backlash** | Slows future booking momentum unless memory is reset |
| **Fan Forgiven** | Arc completed, failure owned, crowd is open again |
| **Crowd Rejected** | No pop sticks. Commentary wary. Booker hesitates. |
| **Breakout Success** | Push remembered as earned. Worker now seen as credible in main events. |
| **Flop Myth** | Push failure became legendary. "They're doing a repeat of the X run." |

---

## System Integration ✅ LOCKED

| System | Push Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| **Worker Resistance (Vol. 5)** | Overpushed workers may refuse to lose. Undervalued ones may check out. |
| **Booking Memory (Vol. 2-3)** | A bad push isn't just forgotten. It reshapes how workers are booked, how feuds are paced. |
| **Fan Reaction Memory** | Pushes track crowd shift over time, even slow drifts ("we stopped caring around February"). |
| **AutoBooker** | High Instinct bookers time push arcs well. Low Instincts botch them. Commentary and world call them out. |
| **Scouting Tags** | "Next Big Thing" or "Late Bloomer" tags affect push success probability and how feds frame the story. |
| **Draft Fallout** | High draft pick fails = backfire. Late pick hits = "push deserved, finally." Draft memory reshapes future angles. |
| **Commentary System** | "They've tried this push before..." or "This is different. You can feel it." Voice of the world. |
| **Buzz System** | Buzz affects how fast a "Climber" becomes "Ascendant," or whether a "Rocketed" push crashes. |

## Key Insight

> **Apathy is worse than heat. Boos are engagement. Silence is death.**

A worker in Floundering state isn't hated, they're *nothing*. The crowd has moved on. This is the hardest state to escape.

## Historical Reference Cases

| Worker | Pattern | Outcome |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Rocky Maivia | Quick heel turn after rejection | Became The Rock, biggest star ever |
| Roman Reigns | 5 years of "push through" | Finally worked after complete reinvention |
| Lex Luger | Failed coronation, no recovery | Never recovered momentum |
| Shota Umino | Failed coronation, no reinvention yet | Currently floundering |
