# Floundering State

📛 **NAME:** Floundering State
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Push System / Terminal State
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** floundering, apathy, crowd indifference, terminal state, reinvention required, the shota zone
📝 **SUMMARY:** Floundering is the terminal state of a failed push where the crowd has moved past rejection into complete apathy. They're not booing, not cheering, just not caring. The worker's momentum is locked near zero and only complete reinvention can salvage their career at the main event level.

## The Core Truth

> **Apathy is worse than heat. Boos are engagement. Silence is death.**

A worker in Floundering state isn't hated, they're *nothing*. The crowd has moved on. This is the hardest state to escape.

---

## Entry Conditions

A worker enters Floundering state when:
- 3+ consecutive Make or Break failures without successful recovery
- OR 6+ months in [[Failed_Coronation]] with no recovery action attempted
- OR 12+ months of sustained [[False_Popularity]] with no resolution

---

## Effects

### Crowd Disposition
- **Complete apathy:** Not booing, not cheering, not reacting
- **"Change the channel" energy:** Matches don't matter
- **No engagement:** Quality of match irrelevant to crowd investment

### Career Impact
| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Momentum Locked** | Near zero, can't build heat |
| **Pop Growth Stalled** | Completely flat, no upward movement |
| **Booking Futility** | No amount of push can force engagement |
| **Match Ratings Suffer** | Crowd indifference tanks perceived quality |

### Tags Applied
- "Floundering"
- "Crowd Apathy"
- May retain "Failed Coronation" and "Manufactured Star" tags

## The Shota Problem

**Shota Umino Case Study:**

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Pre-Dome** | Strong push, fans on the fence, not rejecting but not buying in |
| **Wrestle Kingdom** | Make or Break vs ZSJ, main event for IWGP title |
| **Result** | Underwhelming loss, crowd didn't invest |
| **Post-Dome** | Same character continues, no reinvention |
| **Current State** | Floundering. Fans don't care anymore. |

**Key Insight:** Shota isn't hated. He's just... there. That's worse.

## What Doesn't Work

Strategies that **fail** from Floundering state:

| Failed Strategy | Why It Fails |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **More Push** | Crowd has already rejected; pushing harder confirms their cynicism |
| **Big Match Wins** | Wins don't matter if crowd doesn't care about outcomes |
| **Title Runs** | Putting title on floundering star damages title prestige |
| **Dream Matches** | Wastes opponent's heat; crowd cheers opponent, ignores floundering star |
| **Promo Time** | More exposure without character change = more apathy |
| **Feud with Hot Opponent** | Hot opponent gets crowd, floundering star remains cold |

**The Trap:** Everything the company typically does to make stars doesn't work here because the fundamental problem is belief, not exposure.

## Only Exits

### 1. Complete Reinvention (60-70% success if done well)

**Requirements:**
- Total character overhaul (new name, look, presentation, alignment)
- Extended time off before return often helps
- Must feel like genuinely different person
- Company must commit fully (no half-measures)

**Example:** Roman Reigns → Tribal Chief
- New music
- New look (no vest)
- Heel turn
- Faction (Bloodline)
- Completely different character
- Time off (leukemia) helped reset

**Success Factors:**
| Factor | Importance |
|--------|------------|
| Genuine Transformation | Critical |
| Time Gap | Very Helpful |
| Alignment Change | Very Helpful |
| New Presentation | Important |
| Company Commitment | Critical |

### 2. Extended Depush/Cooling Off (40-50% success)

**Requirements:**
- Remove from TV entirely OR reduce to enhancement
- 12-24 months minimum
- Return as "fresh start"

**Risks:**
- May never regain momentum
- Company may lose interest
- Worker morale may collapse

### 3. Territory Change (Circumstantial)

**Requirements:**
- Leave for different company/territory
- Clean slate in new environment

**Reality:**
- Works better for some than others
- Reputation may follow
- New company may not push

### 4. Accept Reduced Role

**Requirements:**
- Abandon main event aspirations
- Accept midcard/tag team/manager role

**Reality:**
- Some workers can have good careers without being "the guy"
- Requires ego adjustment (check [[Hidden_Personality]])
- Not a failure, just a different path

---

## Time Limits

**Open Question:** Does Floundering have a time limit before becoming permanent?

**Current Thinking:**
- 12-18 months: Recovery still possible with right reinvention
- 18-24 months: Very difficult, company may have given up
- 24+ months: May be permanently associated with failure
- Exception: Major external event (injury return, shoot incident, viral moment) can reset perception

---

## The Roman Exception

Roman Reigns spent approximately 2-3 years in Floundering (2018-2020) before the Tribal Chief reinvention worked.

**What Made It Work:**
- Time off (leukemia created genuine sympathy reset)
- Complete character change (not tweaks, TOTAL overhaul)
- Alignment flip (face → heel)
- New presentation (music, look, attitude, faction)
- Company fully committed
- Perfect timing (pandemic era, fresh start)

**Cost:** 5 total years of WWE's top babyface spot being damaged or empty.

## LLM Integration

AI should:
- Recognize when worker has entered Floundering
- Stop suggesting normal booking fixes
- Recommend reinvention paths only
- Generate realistic assessments ("At this point, only a complete character change...")
- Flag to player that normal strategies won't work
