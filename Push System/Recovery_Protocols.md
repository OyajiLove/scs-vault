# Recovery Protocols

📛 **NAME:** Recovery Protocols
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Push System / Recovery Mechanics
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** recovery, heel turn, step back, reinvention, repackage, salvage, failed push recovery
📝 **SUMMARY:** When a push fails, specific recovery actions can salvage the worker's career. Each protocol has different success rates, time requirements, and is suited to different situations. The deeper into failure states, the more drastic the recovery required.

## Recovery Overview

| Protocol | Success Rate | Time Required | Best For | Available From |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **Heel Turn** | 70-80% | 1-3 months | Workers crowd wants to hate | False Pop, Failed Coronation |
| **Step Back** | 50-60% | 6-12 months | Workers who need to rebuild | False Pop, Failed Coronation |
| **Gimmick Tweak** | 40-50% | 3-6 months | Minor adjustments needed | False Pop, Failed Coronation |
| **Complete Reinvention** | 60-70% | 6-18 months | Severe damage | Failed Coronation, Floundering |

## Heel Turn

### Description
Lean into the crowd's rejection. If they want to boo, let them boo. Transform rejection into heat.

### Success Rate: 70-80%

### Requirements
- Worker has some character work ability
- Crowd is actively hostile (not apathetic)
- Company willing to commit to heel run
- Story justification exists (betrayal, attitude change)

### Execution
1. **Trigger event:** Betrayal, attack on beloved face, verbal turn
2. **Commit fully:** No tweener, no cool heel, full villain
3. **Generate heat:** Promos, cheap shots, cowardly tactics
4. **Let crowd enjoy hating:** Don't fight their reaction, channel it

### Time Required: 1-3 months to establish, 6-12 months to fully convert

### Best Example: Rocky Maivia → The Rock
- Rejected as bland babyface
- Joined Nation of Domination as heel
- Leaned into arrogance
- Crowd loved to hate him
- Eventually became most over star ever

### Why It Works
- Converts rejection into asset
- Crowd gets to feel vindicated ("we knew he was bad")
- Heat is engagement, engagement is money
- Can eventually turn back face with earned support

### Why It Might Fail
- Worker has no heel charisma
- Company books as "cool heel" (undermines purpose)
- Crowd is already apathetic (no reaction to channel)
- Half-hearted execution

---

## Step Back

### Description
Remove from main event scene. Rebuild credibility in midcard. Let crowd miss them before next push.

### Success Rate: 50-60%

### Requirements
- Company patience (6-12 months)
- Worker ego can handle "demotion"
- Midcard opponents available to build against
- Clear rebuild plan

### Execution
1. **Remove from spotlight:** No main events, no title programs
2. **Quality midcard work:** Good matches, character moments
3. **Organic moments:** Let crowd come to them
4. **Gradual reintroduction:** When crowd demands it

### Time Required: 6-12 months minimum

### Best Example: Lex Luger post-WM X
- Failed coronation
- Stepped back to upper midcard
- (In Luger's case, didn't fully recover, but this was the right path)

### Why It Works
- Absence creates demand
- Removes pressure
- Allows character refinement
- Crowd memory of failure fades

### Why It Might Fail
- Company impatient, pushes too soon
- Worker demands spotlight back
- Momentum never rebuilds
- Buried in "purgatory" forever

---

## Gimmick Tweak

### Description
Adjust character elements to fit crowd's perception without complete overhaul.

### Success Rate: 40-50%

### Requirements
- Problem is character-specific, not fundamental
- Core can be salvaged
- Minor adjustments would help
- Worker can adapt performance

### Execution
1. **Identify disconnect:** What specifically isn't working?
2. **Adjust elements:** Promos, moveset, presentation
3. **Test reactions:** Monitor crowd response
4. **Iterate:** Continue adjusting until it clicks

### Time Required: 3-6 months

### Examples
- Adding edge to bland babyface
- Tweaking catchphrases
- Adjusting in-ring style
- Minor presentation changes

### Why It Works
- Preserves what works
- Less risky than complete overhaul
- Can be done gradually
- Tests hypotheses about what's wrong

### Why It Might Fail
- Problem is fundamental, not cosmetic
- Tweaks are too minor
- Crowd has already made up mind
- Inconsistent execution

---

## Complete Reinvention

### Description
Total character overhaul. New name, new look, new presentation, new alignment. Essentially debut as new person.

### Success Rate: 60-70% (when done properly)

### Requirements
- Severe damage (Floundering or deep Failed Coronation)
- Company commitment to fresh start
- Worker ability to transform
- Time gap helpful (absence before return)

### Execution
1. **Time off:** Ideally 3-6 months away
2. **Complete change:** Everything must be different
3. **Reintroduce as new:** Commentary, presentation should treat as fresh
4. **Commit:** No references to old character, no half-measures

### Time Required: 6-18 months total (including time off)

### Best Example: Roman Reigns → Tribal Chief
- New music
- New look (no tactical vest)
- New attitude (heel)
- New faction (Bloodline)
- New presentation (Paul Heyman, special entrance)
- Treated as completely different person

### Why It Works
- Breaks association with failure
- Gives crowd permission to reassess
- Creates genuine new character to invest in
- Time gap allows memory to fade

### Why It Might Fail
- Half-hearted execution (kept old music, etc.)
- No time gap (crowd remembers immediately)
- New character also doesn't connect
- Company abandons commitment

---

## Time Off + Return

### Description
Absence creates demand. Step away, let memory fade, return fresh.

### Success Rate: 50-70% (depending on absence cause)

### Requirements
- Reason for absence (injury, "personal time," excursion)
- Company patience
- Worker remains relevant (some buzz during absence)
- Return properly built

### Execution
1. **Exit cleanly:** Injury, storyline exit, or quiet departure
2. **Stay away:** 3-12 months depending on situation
3. **Build anticipation:** Teases, rumors, vignettes
4. **Return big:** Major event, significant moment

### Time Required: 3-12 months away

### Special Case: Injury/External Event
- Roman's leukemia created genuine sympathy
- Changed crowd's relationship with him
- External factors can accelerate recovery

### Why It Works
- Absence creates demand
- Memory of failure fades
- Return creates natural buzz
- Fresh start feeling

### Why It Might Fail
- Audience forgets entirely (too long)
- Return poorly executed
- Same character returns (no change)
- Absence wasn't long enough

---

## Push Through (Not Recommended)

### Description
Ignore rejection. Keep pushing. Force the issue. Wait for crowd to give up resisting.

### Success Rate: 10-20%

### Requirements
- Company stubbornness
- Worker's physical/mental endurance
- Willingness to accept years of rejection
- Eventually complete reinvention anyway

### Execution
1. Keep pushing despite rejection
2. Weather years of boos
3. Eventually do what you should have done originally

### Time Required: Years (3-5+)

### Example: Roman Reigns 2015-2020
- Pushed as top babyface despite rejection
- 5 years of "Let's Go Roman / Roman Sucks"
- Eventually did complete reinvention anyway
- Could have saved 4 years by pivoting earlier

### Why It (Occasionally) Works
- Crowd eventually exhausts itself
- Some portion accepts through attrition
- Company controls narrative (casual fans don't care)

### Why It Usually Fails
- Damages years of programming
- Burns crowd trust
- Worker suffers psychologically
- Usually requires reinvention anyway
- Just delays inevitable

**Recommendation:** Almost never the right choice. If you're considering this, you should probably just do reinvention now.
