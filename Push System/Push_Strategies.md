## Slow Build

### Description
Gradual elevation over 12-18 months. Worker moves from opening matches to midcard to upper midcard to main event naturally.

### Risk Level: Low
### False Popularity Risk: Very Low

### Execution
1. Start in opening/lower midcard
2. Quality matches, character moments
3. First midcard feud (3-4 months)
4. Upper midcard program (4-6 months)
5. First main event tease (month 10-12)
6. Full main event push (month 12-18)

### Best For
- Workers without obvious star power
- Developing talent
- Patient companies
- Building genuine connection

### Example
- Daniel Bryan's early WWE run (before crowd forced faster push)
- Most Japanese "ace track" pushes

### Why It Works
- Gap never exceeds threshold
- Crowd comes along for journey
- Failures at lower levels = lower stakes
- Worker improves during process

### Drawbacks
- Requires patience
- Worker may leave for faster push elsewhere
- Company may lose window if momentum doesn't build

---

## Organic Rise

### Description
Follow the crowd's lead. Push who they choose. React to genuine reactions rather than forcing narrative.

### Risk Level: Very Low
### False Popularity Risk: None (by definition)

### Execution
1. Monitor crowd reactions
2. Identify organic favorites
3. Book to crowd's desire
4. Elevate who they're choosing

### Best For
- "Daniel Bryan" situations
- "Becky Lynch" situations  
- Any worker crowd is choosing without booking support

### Example
- Daniel Bryan 2013-2014 (crowd forced WWE's hand)
- Becky Lynch 2018-2019 (crowd chose her over Charlotte)
- Steve Austin 1996-1997 (crowd demanded babyface turn)

### Why It Works
- Zero gap by definition
- Crowd invested because it's their choice
- Feels earned, not manufactured
- Creates genuine stars

### Drawbacks
- Company loses control
- May not be who company wanted
- Requires ability to read crowds
- May elevate someone company can't capitalize on

---

## Moderate Push

### Description
Steady elevation over 6-12 months. Faster than slow build, but with checkpoints.

### Risk Level: Low-Medium
### False Popularity Risk: Low

### Execution
1. Start in midcard with wins
2. First significant feud (months 2-4)
3. Upper midcard by month 6
4. Main event program month 8-12

### Best For
- Most workers
- Standard elevation
- When company has specific timeline

### Why It Works
- Balanced approach
- Time to course-correct
- Most situations

### Drawbacks
- May be too slow for genuine stars
- May be too fast for workers who need more development

## Rocket Push

### Description
Fast-track to main event in 3-6 months. High risk, high reward.

### Risk Level: High
### False Popularity Risk: High

### Execution
1. Debut/repackage strong
2. Immediately in significant programs
3. Major wins early
4. Main event by month 3-6

### Best For
- Obvious stars
- Hot free agent signings
- Legitimate buzz already exists
- Desperate need for new main eventer

### Example
- Goldberg's undefeated streak
- Brock Lesnar 2002
- CM Punk (when done correctly)

### Requirements for Success
- Worker must have "it"
- Crowd must buy in quickly
- Quality opponents available
- Company must commit fully

### Why It Might Work
- Some workers are obviously stars
- Strike while iron is hot
- Capitalize on buzz
- Fill urgent need

### Why It Usually Fails
- Forces gap before organic buy-in
- No time to course-correct
- Sets unrealistic expectations
- If it doesn't work immediately, very hard to recover

### Warning Signs
- Crowd not responding
- "This feels forced" reactions
- Smart fan backlash building
- Merch not moving despite push

---

## Coronation Push

### Description
"This is the guy" from day one. Maximum push immediately.

### Risk Level: Very High
### False Popularity Risk: Very High

### Execution
1. Debut as main eventer
2. Immediately in title picture
3. Maximum TV time, promo time, production
4. "Next big thing" commentary treatment

### Best For
- Almost no one
- Only when worker has undeniable buzz before debut
- Pre-made stars from other promotions

### Example
- Lex Luger (failed)
- Roman Reigns 2015 (failed for years)
- Rare success: AJ Styles to WWE (but he had 15+ years of proof)

### Requirements for Success
- Pre-existing reputation
- Undeniable buzz
- Crowd already believes
- Worker can immediately deliver at main event level

### Why It Almost Always Fails
- No time for buy-in
- Massive gap immediately
- Crowd rejects "chosen one" narrative
- No fallback if it doesn't work

### When to Actually Use This
- Legitimate megastar from another company
- Returning legend
- Maybe 1-2 workers per decade

## 50/50 Booking

### Description
Alternating wins and losses without clear direction. Everyone beats everyone.

### Risk Level: Medium (different problem than False Pop)
### False Popularity Risk: Medium (creates different issues)

### Effect
- Kills momentum for everyone
- Fans lose interest in outcomes
- No one feels special
- "What's the point?" reaction

### Why Companies Do It
- "Keep everyone strong"
- Avoid making decisions
- Hedge bets
- Political balance

### Why It's Bad
- Predictability in unpredictability
- No stars created
- Matches feel meaningless
- Crowd checks out

### The Problem
Not exactly False Popularity, but creates **Staleness** and **Predictability** issues. See [[Predictability_Stakes]].

---

## Veteran Protection

### Description
Keep legends strong even as they decline. Veterans rarely lose clean.

### Risk Level: Medium
### False Popularity Risk: Low (for the veteran)

### Effect on Veteran
- Maintains legacy
- Crowds still buy them as threat
- Can still headline

### Effect on Roster
- Young talent can't get clean wins
- Creates frustration
- Blocks elevation paths
- "Glass ceiling" problems

### When It's Justified
- Short-term
- Specific dream match builds
- Retirement program setup

### When It's Problematic
- Extended over years
- Blocks entire generation
- Veteran no longer draws but still protected

## Red Flags for Rocket/Coronation Push

Before attempting fast push, check for these warning signs:

| Red Flag | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Worker hasn't connected organically yet | High False Pop risk |
| Smart fan base (smarky territory) | More resistant to manufactured stars |
| No clear character hook | Nothing for crowd to invest in |
| Limited promo ability | Can't build own heat |
| Chosen for look/politics over crowd response | Gap will be obvious |
| Previous failed push | "Fool Me Once" in effect |

If 2+ red flags present, **do not** attempt Rocket or Coronation push.
