# False Popularity

📛 **NAME:** False Popularity
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Push System / Worker State
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** false popularity, manufactured star, crowd rejection, backlash, overpush
📝 **SUMMARY:** False Popularity is the state where a worker is being pushed as a star but the crowd hasn't organically accepted them. The crowd becomes hostile, growth slows, and the worker faces a Make or Break moment at the next major event.

---

## Trigger Conditions

False Popularity activates when:
- **Push Gap ≥ 20** (Push Level - Organic Pop)
- Sustained for **4+ consecutive weeks**

---

## Effects

### Immediate Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **"Manufactured Star" Tag** | Applied to worker, visible in system |
| **Crowd Flip** | Intended cheers become boos |
| **Pop Growth 0.5x** | Harder to actually get over |
| **Merch Stall** | Sales plateau or decline despite push |
| **Smart Fan Backlash** | Intensified criticism online/in arena |

### Ongoing Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Crowd Hijacking Risk** | Every appearance risks competing chants |
| **Commentary Awkwardness** | Have to work around rejection ("polarizing," "controversial") |
| **Opponent Elevation** | Opponents get cheered regardless of alignment |
| **Morale Impact** | Worker morale affected (varies by [[Hidden_Personality]]) |

### Crowd Memory Effects

- **"Fool Me Once" activates** - Each failed push attempt makes next attempt harder
- **Pattern Recognition** - Crowd remembers "They're going to force this guy no matter what"
- **Resistance Builds** - Future pushes start with deficit

## Worker Response (Hidden Personality)

| Personality Type | Response to Rejection |
|------------------|----------------------|
| **High Ego** | Blames crowd, demands bigger push, backstage complaints |
| **Low Ego** | Self-doubt, performance suffers, may request less exposure |
| **High Drive** | Works harder, may break through eventually |
| **Low Drive** | Checks out, coasts, accepts fate |
| **Politician** | Lobbies management, undermines rivals |
| **Professional** | Does the job, waits for opportunity |

---

## Duration

False Popularity persists until:

1. **Breakthrough** at Make or Break moment (gap closes, tag removed)
2. **Recovery Action** taken (heel turn, step back, repackage)
3. **Depush** (company gives up, removes from spotlight)
4. **Degradation** to Failed Coronation (after Make or Break failure)

Without intervention, False Popularity doesn't resolve on its own.

## Historical Examples

### Rocky Maivia (1996-1997)
- Push Level: 75 (IC Champion, fast-tracked)
- Organic Pop: ~40 (generic babyface, no connection)
- Gap: 35 (severe)
- Crowd Response: "Die Rocky Die" chants
- **Resolution:** Heel turn → complete reinvention → The Rock

### Roman Reigns (2015-2020)
- Push Level: 95 (franchise player booking)
- Organic Pop: ~55-60 (respected worker, not beloved)
- Gap: 35-40 (severe)
- Crowd Response: "Let's Go Roman / Roman Sucks" dueling chants, years of rejection
- **Resolution:** 5 years of damage before complete reinvention worked

### Lex Luger (1993-1994)
- Push Level: 90 (Lex Express, next Hogan)
- Organic Pop: ~50 (decent worker, no organic heat)
- Gap: 40 (severe)
- Crowd Response: Tepid, never bought in
- **Resolution:** Failed Coronation → never recovered

---

## What Triggers Make or Break

When a worker in False Popularity state is booked into:
- **Major Event** (PPV, supercard, Dome show)
- **Main Event or Semi-Main** card position
- **High Stakes** (title match, blowoff, career stakes)

That match becomes a [[Make_or_Break]] moment.

## Prevention

Best strategies to avoid False Popularity:

| Strategy | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Slow Build** | 12-18 month elevation, gap never exceeds threshold |
| **Organic Rise** | Follow crowd's lead, push who they choose |
| **Test Runs** | Short spotlight periods to gauge reaction before committing |
| **Character Work First** | Establish connection before major push |
| **Listen to Crowds** | Adjust push based on actual reactions |
