# Booking Trails

📛 **SYSTEM:** Booking Trails
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Booking & Simulation / Long-Term Planning
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** booking trails, long-term booking, backwards planning, destination match, storyline arc, calendar
📝 **SUMMARY:** A long-term planning tool that works backwards from a chosen "destination match" (blow-off, debut, title win, retirement), building an emotional trail of segments, turns, feuds, and matches that culminate in that peak moment.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Start with destination (the payoff match), then plan backwards
- Player sets milestones as emotional beats, not fully detailed segments
- Calendar integration shows show dates with visual cue system
- Trails can be edited, split, or revised without destroying the arc
- AI can suggest trail segments via Road Agent logic
- Trails feed into [[Feud_Memory]] and [[Fan Memory Engine/_Fan Memory Index|Fan Memory]] systems

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Yes. LLM can generate Road Agent suggestions, flag emotional redundancy, and assist with milestone naming/descriptions.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 (concept), Vol 6 (formalized)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- [[Feud_Memory]] - Booking Trails feed into emotional arc tracking
- [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz System]] - Trail pacing affects Buzz curves
- [[Fan Memory Engine/_Fan Memory Index|Fan Memory Engine]] - Successful trails generate snapshots
- [[Contract System/Worker Resistance|Push Resistance]] - Failed trails cause political friction
- AutoBooker - AI uses trail templates for long-term planning

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Maximum recommended trail length (12 weeks? 6 months? 1 year?)
- How do injury/unexpected events interrupt active Trails?
- Can multiple Trails intersect (e.g., two workers on separate trails that converge)?

✅ **STATUS:** Locked

## Core Concept

**"Start with a destination match (the blow-off), then book backwards from there."**

This reflects real wrestling logic: Gedo, Dusty, and other legendary bookers knew where they wanted to end up, then built the road to get there.

A Trail is not a railroad. It's a path with flexibility, milestones, and emotional checkpoints.
