## HOOK

### WHAT IS SQUARED CIRCLE SOUL?

Wrestling is a story people choose to believe, told through pain, trust, betrayal, and memory.

Most wrestling games track outcomes. They log wins and titles, but forget how it felt to lose the wrong way or win too early. They forget what gets remembered.

SCS is a wrestling simulator built on memory, momentum, emotion, and consequence. It lets you shape a world that responds to pressure and remembers what mattered. A world where decisions have weight, people have reasons, and surprises make sense in hindsight.

This is not a spreadsheet with wrestling skin. This is the politics, the heartbreak, the ego, and the grind. This is what it feels like to book.

---

## FEATURES

---

### 1. THE RINGSTATE

The default world of SCS is the Ringstate: 1985, alternate history, wrestling at the center of Cold War culture.

Six alliances with different philosophies. CCA traditionalists protecting the old ways. GWA corporate machines building empires. PWU socialist collectives running worker-owned promotions. CFPW Indigenous sovereignty reclaiming the sport. LGBTQW+ queer liberation carving space in hostile territory. Blade Underground survivalists booking in warehouses and parking lots.

Hundreds of workers with documented histories, relationships, grudges, and arcs waiting to unfold. Territories with distinct fan cultures and political realities. A world dense enough to explore for years.

You can play it straight. Or tear it apart and build your own. Import real-world mods at launch. Create fictional universes from scratch. Use the AI to generate entire rosters with regional histories and functioning free agent scenes.

The Ringstate is the canvas. What you paint is up to you.

---

### 2. PLAY YOUR WAY

Not everyone wants the same game. SCS respects that.

The e-fedder who wants to write every promo, script every angle, and control every word their workers say: the game supports that. Full creative control. Nothing generated without your approval.

The ideas person who wants to set direction but not micromanage: give the AI bullet points. "Dusty cuts a promo about his daddy. Emotional. Ends with a challenge." The system builds it in Dusty's voice, respecting his cadence and vocabulary. You approve, tweak, or rewrite.

The gamer who wants to see results and skip the emotional beats: turn down the granularity. Book matches, set feuds, let the simulation handle the rest. Check in when something needs your attention.

SCS scales to how you want to engage. Deep or shallow. Hands-on or delegated. Your playstyle isn't wrong. It's a setting.

---

### 3. PEOPLE HAVE REASONS

Ash Morrow isn't randomly disloyal. He's trapped.

In 1976, a bar fight in Odessa went wrong. A man died. Ray Harlan made the case disappear. Nine years later, Ray called in the debt. Now Ash jobs when he's told, cuts hollow promos, drinks too much, and waits for a chance that might never come.

His loyalty stat isn't low because of RNG. It's low because of blackmail. His paranoia isn't flavor text. It's survival. If you push him too far, he might snap on live TV. Or he might leak the truth to a journalist. Or he might wait outside the Amarillo dome with a steel pipe.

Every worker in SCS has context. Their behavior follows from their situation. When someone acts out, you can trace why. When someone stays loyal beyond reason, there's a story there too.

---

### 4. THE WORLD MAKES SENSE

The Road Warriors don't break up because you booked them in separate matches twice. New Day doesn't implode after one loss. Relationships have weight, history, reasons.

When a tag team splits, you can trace why. A decade of loyalty doesn't evaporate randomly. Betrayals need pressure, resentment, opportunity. The game tracks the buildup.

Same with AI promotions. They don't fire half the roster on week one. They don't shutter every stable because the algorithm felt like it. Bookers have philosophies. Owners have agendas. Decisions follow from character, not dice rolls.

When something satisfying happens in SCS, you can look back and see the path. That's what makes the surprises land.

---

### 5. LOGICAL UNPREDICTABILITY

You didn't see it coming. But looking back, of course it happened.

A veteran snaps on live TV. A golden boy walks out before the biggest show of the year. A faction war tears your locker room apart during a title tournament.

These moments emerge from pressure, not randomness. The game tracks grudges, egos, booking patterns, and unresolved tension. When things explode, there's a fuse you could've spotted if you were paying attention.

SCS gives you chaos you can believe in. The simulation runs on logic, and logic creates drama. You're not fighting dice rolls. You're managing consequences.

---

### 6. BOOKING TRAILS

Long-term booking is hard. SCS makes it easy.

Booking Trails let you design backwards. Start with the blowoff you want: Piper vs. Hogan in a cage. Then tell the system what you need to get there.

"Three match series. First two end in interference and count outs so the cage feels like a logical escalation. Piper targets Hogan's insincerity. Hogan defends Hulkamania. Give me one loaded angle to kick it off."

The trail goes up on your calendar. Beat for beat. Promos, matches, run-ins, all scheduled and sequenced. You can adjust any piece manually, talk it through with your assistant booker, or let it run as designed.

Be as detailed or big picture as you want. Specify every promo bullet or just set the destination and let the system map the route. The game handles the connective tissue. You handle the vision.

Booking trails turn "I want this feud to mean something" into a plan you can execute.

---

### 7. USE YOUR WORDS

Type a promo. Speak to a wrestler backstage. Lie to a veteran's face about their push. Promise a tag team you'll keep them together, then don't.

SCS lets you use your actual words. The AI responds to what you say and how you say it. Workers remember. Some forgive. Some don't.

Negotiate with booking committees. Talk your way through alliance boards. Handle the press after a scandal breaks. Tell a rising star they're not ready yet and watch how they take it.

You can also stay silent. Dodge the question. Let someone else take the heat. But silence is a choice too, and people notice.

---

### 8. PROMOS SOUND LIKE PEOPLE

Eric Embry doesn't talk like Hulk Hogan. Dusty Rhodes doesn't talk like Ric Flair. The DNA is different.

SCS tracks promo style as a system. Cadence, vocabulary, emotional register, signature phrases. When you generate a promo or let the AI voice a character, it sounds like that character. A southern brawler drawls. A corporate heel enunciates. A joshi legend speaks through translators with precision.

You can write your own promos too. Or give the AI bullet points and let it build something in the worker's voice. Either way, the words feel grounded in who's speaking.

When two workers with clashing styles cut promos at each other, the friction is part of the story.

---

### 9. ASSISTANT BOOKERS

You don't have to run everything alone. Hire an assistant booker and delegate.

But assistants aren't tools. They're people with skills, limitations, personalities, and agendas.

A veteran road agent has deep locker room connections. Workers trust him. He hears things you don't. But he's old school, and he'll quietly bury a young worker who gets too cocky after a few good performances. You might not find out until the damage is done.

A young hungry assistant has fresh ideas but no political capital. The locker room doesn't respect her yet. She needs wins to build credibility, and she'll remember if you undercut her.

Some assistants shield their favorites from criticism. Some work against you and plot coups while feeding you valuable insight you can't get anywhere else. The question is whether their value outweighs their risk.

You're not just delegating tasks. You're managing another ego in a room full of them.

---

### 10. THE POLITICS OF WRESTLING

Booking committees are optional. Turn them on and you're not a dictator anymore. You're one voice in a room full of egos.

A veteran wants his protégé pushed. An owner wants family-friendly content. A road agent thinks your main event should go longer. Everyone has an agenda, and you need enough support to get your ideas through.

Alliance boards work the same way. You're a member, not a king. Build stock by playing ball. Spend it when you need something. Burn bridges and watch your influence crater.

Meanwhile, the locker room forms cliques. Veterans protect their spots. Young guys resent the glass ceiling. Egos run wild if you let them.

Power in SCS is negotiated. Every night, in every hallway.

---

### 11. YOUR FANBASE IS AT WAR

Fans aren't a monolith. They're factions.

Purists want technical wrestling and long-term storytelling. Crash TV addicts want violence and surprises. Workrate fetishists grade matches on move counts. Cynical ironists cheer heels for the wrong reasons. Loyalists defend everything you do until they don't.

These groups coexist inside your audience. They argue with each other. They pull your booking in different directions. Lean too hard into one and you lose another.

SCS tracks fan subcultures and their tensions. Your decisions shift the composition of who watches. Build a hardcore base or chase casuals. You can't please everyone, so choose who you're willing to lose.

---

### 12. THE FALSE IDOL COLLAPSES

You pushed them. The crowd didn't want them. Now it's falling apart.

SCS knows when a push lacks organic support. The game tracks whether reactions are earned or manufactured. A worker with high TV time and title shots but flat crowd investment is a false idol. Keep pushing and the rejection gets louder.

Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 32. Lex Luger's bus tour. The systems detect the pattern: spotlight without belief.

You can try to force it. Sometimes the crowd comes around. But if the gap between push and investment stays too wide for too long, the backlash becomes the story. The golden boy becomes the scapegoat. Your booking failure becomes their career baggage.

---

### 13. SCANDALS ARE A CRAPSHOOT

Your champion gets arrested at 3am. The press is circling. Social media is on fire. What do you do?

You can own it. Suspend them publicly, apologize, take the short-term hit and hope the honesty builds trust. Or you can bury it. Deny, deflect, hope it blows over.

But skeletons don't stay buried. If the truth comes out later, it's worse. Fans remember you lied. Workers remember you chose PR over principle. Your reputation takes damage that doesn't heal.

Sometimes there's no clean answer. Sometimes you're choosing between bad options. SCS doesn't give you a "correct" response. It gives you consequences.

---

### 14. LOCKER ROOM JUSTICE

Veterans hold court.

If a worker sandbagged your top guy, you might not hear about it first. The locker room handles its own. Informal trials. Unwritten rules. Punishments that range from cold shoulders to receipts in the ring.

SCS simulates the politics backstage. Cliques form around veterans, styles, or shared history. Loyalty flows through these networks. Cross the wrong person and the room turns cold. Earn respect and doors open.

You can intervene. Take sides. Ignore it and hope it resolves. But the locker room remembers how you handled it. Side with the wrong guy and trust erodes. Stay neutral and some will call you weak.

There's no HR department. Just reputations and consequences.

---

### 15. THE WORLD MOVES WITHOUT YOU

News happens. Inside wrestling and outside it.

A scandal breaks in a rival promotion. A recession hits and your gate revenue drops. A moral panic about violence forces you to soften your product or lose venues. A beloved legend dies and the whole industry pauses.

These events shape what's possible. They change fan expectations, sponsor tolerance, and cultural context. A women's deathmatch tournament might get you blacklisted in 1985 but celebrated in 2005.

No two playthroughs diverge the same way. The Ringstate responds to pressure from everywhere. You're booking inside history, and history doesn't wait for you.

---

### 16. THE CROWD REMEMBERS WRONG

Fans don't just forget. They misremember.

A heel's cheap victory becomes a face's triumphant stand in hindsight. A forgettable midcard match becomes a legendary war because someone died six months later. The screwjob that actually happened gets mythologized into something bigger.

SCS tracks how memories drift over time. Fresh events are clear. Older events soften, distort, get emotionally recolored by what happened after.

Twenty years later, fans swear the babyface won that night in Philly. He didn't. But that's how they remember it, and memory is what matters.

History in SCS is contested. What happened and what people believe happened are different systems.

---

### 17. SYMPATHY HAS A SHELF LIFE

The first time they fight through injury, the crowd loves it. The third time, they're invested. The tenth time, it's a joke.

SCS tracks sympathy freshness. An affliction, a tragedy, a personal struggle: these create emotional investment. But milk them too long and the crowd turns. What started as heroic becomes pathetic. What felt real becomes a gimmick.

Matt Jackson clutching his back for the fifth straight match. A babyface whose entire character is "I got screwed." The crowd notices when you're working them.

Sympathy is a resource. Spend it wisely. Give your workers time to heal, time to evolve. Let the story breathe. Or don't, and watch goodwill curdle into contempt.

---

### 18. GOLDEN ERAS DIE

Every boom ends. The question is whether you survive it.

SCS tracks the lifecycle of golden eras. The peak where everything works. The first cracks when what made you special starts feeling stale. The slow bleed when talent leaves, crowds shrink, and the magic fades. The collapse when it all falls apart at once.

WCW in 2000. The territories in 1984. Your promotion after the ace retires and the new generation can't carry the weight.

You can see it coming. The metrics shift. The heat cools. The question is whether you adapt, rebuild, or ride it into the ground.

Some eras end gracefully. Others become cautionary tales. SCS lets you experience both.

---

### 19. THE DEAD AREN'T NEUTRAL

When a worker dies, the industry doesn't just move on. It responds.

SCS tracks how the dead are remembered. Tribute shows. Ten-bell salutes. Memorial tournaments. But also: exploitation. Tasteless angles. Promotions that milk tragedy for heat.

Eddie Guerrero becomes a sacred symbol. Owen Hart's death creates a foundation and a legal war. Benoit gets erased. Pillman's early grave becomes mythology.

You choose how your promotion handles loss. Honor them or use them. The fanbase watches. Workers watch. Your reputation shifts based on whether you treated the dead with dignity or turned their memory into content.

The ghosts of wrestling history have weight in SCS. How you carry them matters.

---

### 20. DRAFTS THAT MATTER

In SCS, the draft isn't a prelude. It's your first war.

Choose your format: snake, lottery, live auction, or wildcard order. Rig the draft pool if the house rules allow. Protect your champions. Bid on legends. Or let chaos dictate the board.

Every pick creates ripple effects. Draft someone 59th and they might carry that slight for years. Skip a tag partner mid-draft and watch morale collapse. Steal a rival's favorite worker and they'll remember it when you need a favor.

The AI runs deep emotional logic during drafts. Bookers consider popularity, style fit, locker room chemistry, ego management, historical ties, and promotion identity. It's not about the best overall stat. It's about who fits the vision and who will survive the room.

Eternal Champions Mode takes it further. Draft workers from their all-time peaks across eras, styles, and mods. Form a tag team with two legends who never shared a ring. Book fantasy wars between generations. The AI respects legacy, chemistry, and clash potential, and adjusts the game world accordingly.

The draft sets the stage. And you'll be living with it for a long time.

---

### 21. MULTIPLAYER YOUR WAY

SCS supports multiplayer across a shared, reactive wrestling world, at whatever pace your group wants.

Asynchronous mode: each promoter books their week whenever they have time. Once everyone locks in, the sim processes everything together. Free agent signings, scandals, ratings, injuries, shifts in crowd perception: all of it hits at the same time. No one peeks ahead. Good for groups spread across time zones or busy schedules.

Day-by-day mode: players rotate through each calendar day in sequence. You finish your day, player two gets a notification that it's their turn, they finish theirs, player three gets pinged. Deliberate and meticulous. Everyone moves through time together, one day at a time. You see the ripples of yesterday's decisions before you make today's.

You can trade talent, flip draft picks, loan champions, co-book supershows, or undercut each other's big events. Start with a shared draft or accurate rosters. Pick an era. Launch with random debuts from a modded historical database. The system handles whatever tone or format you choose.

Every promotion, whether AI or player-controlled, books with intent. The system tracks how each player operates: who pushes fast, who buries talent, who betrays allies. It adjusts strategies accordingly.

Undercut a supershow? They'll retaliate. Break a handshake deal? They'll blacklist you. Develop a reputation as an ace-maker or a company killer, and the entire world bends around it.

---

### 22. PLAY WITH FRIENDS OF ANY SKILL LEVEL

Not everyone knows wrestling the same way. SCS has handicaps that balance the playing field.

New players can reduce fog of war around worker stats and hidden traits. Experienced players fly blind. New players get stronger assistant booker support with better recommendations and more detailed feedback. Experienced players get terse notes and have to figure it out.

Drafts can be weighted. Preferential order for newer players. Extra picks. Protected selections. Whatever the group agrees on.

The goal is competitive multiplayer where no single player dominates just because they've been booking TEW since 2004. Your friend who just started watching wrestling last year can hold their own. Your buddy who runs an e-fed can flex their skills. Everyone gets a game that challenges them.

Set the handicaps before launch. Adjust mid-campaign if someone's struggling or running away with it. Keep the shared world competitive and fun for everyone at the table.

---

### 23. CREDIBILITY IS EARNED

Popularity and credibility are different stats.

Honky Tonk Man was popular. Nobody believed he could beat Bret Hart in a shoot. Dean Malenko was credible. He could walk into any match and the crowd believed he might win, even without a top spot.

SCS tracks credibility separately from overness. It's built through booking logic: clean wins, competitive losses, protected finishes, matches where the worker looked dangerous. It erodes through jobs, comedy spots, and embarrassing angles.

A credible worker can anchor a title reign. A popular worker without credibility gets exposed in big matches. The crowd knows the difference even if they can't articulate it.

Your job is to build both, or decide which one matters more.

---

### 24. HIDDEN TRAITS

What you see on the roster screen isn't everything.

Workers have hidden personality traits that shape how they behave when you're not looking. Paranoia. Ego. Morality. Drive. Anger threshold. Traditionalism. These numbers exist, but you don't see them unless you dig.

A worker with high paranoia interprets neutral booking as a slight. A worker with low morality might leak stories to the press when they're unhappy. A worker with maxed traditionalism will bristle at comedy spots or hardcore gimmicks.

You learn these traits by watching behavior over time. Or by asking around. Veterans gossip. Road agents have opinions. Some things you only find out when it's too late.

The roster is deeper than its stats suggest.

---

### 25. EVERY PLAYTHROUGH DIVERGES

Two players start with the same Ringstate. Same rosters, same relationships, same 1985 snapshot.

Six months in, their worlds are unrecognizable. One player's CCA is dominant because they navigated a scandal well. The other's CCA collapsed because a key veteran walked and took half the locker room with him.

SCS creates divergence through accumulated decisions, emergent events, and logical consequences. The simulation doesn't randomize for variety. It evolves based on what happened.

Your Ringstate becomes yours. The stories it tells belong to your playthrough. When you compare notes with another player, you're comparing alternate histories.

That's the goal: a world that feels real, responds to pressure, and never plays the same way twice.

---

### 26. THE GAME AGES WITH THE ERA

SCS doesn't just simulate different decades. It looks different in them.

In 1975, your booking screen is a smoke-filled office. Rotary phone. Paper calendar. Index cards for your roster. You flip through them like a territory booker hunched over a desk at 2am.

In 1985, it's a cluttered production office. CRT monitors. VHS tapes stacked in the corner. Fax machine humming. The aesthetic shifts to match the technology and culture of the time.

In 2005, you're working from a corporate headquarters. Spreadsheets. Email chains. Conference call reminders. The sleek emptiness of a company that forgot what made it special.

In 2020, it's a mobile app. Push notifications. Social media feeds. Analytics dashboards. The modern wrestling machine.

The UI isn't just decoration. It shapes how you interact with the game. Different eras feel different to play. The friction of older technology is part of the experience. The speed of modern interfaces comes with its own pressures.

You're not just booking in an era. You're living in it.

---

### 27. TITLES HAVE WEIGHT

A championship isn't a prop. It's a living thing with memory.

SCS tracks title prestige on a scale from legendary to dead. Every booking decision affects it. Long reigns with credible champions build prestige. Hot potato booking destroys it. Screwy finishes erode trust. Clean defenses restore it.

The crowd knows. They react differently to a title that means something versus one that's been passed around like a participation trophy. A prestigious belt makes matches feel bigger. A dead belt makes title shots feel like filler.

Lineage matters too. The game tracks who held the belt, how they won it, how they lost it. A worker who wins a title from a legend carries that weight. A worker who wins it from a transitional champion doesn't get the same rub.

You can damage a title. You can also rehabilitate it. Tournaments, heroic runs, signature feuds: these are the tools. But recovery takes years, not weeks. Every short-term fix you took on the way down is a debt you pay on the way back up.

Belts aren't just rewards. They're responsibilities.

---

### 28. FACTIONS LIVE AND DIE

Stables aren't just roster groupings. They're organisms.

SCS tracks faction stability on a 0-100 scale. Chemistry between members. Internal friction. Goal alignment. Warning signs before collapse. You can see a breakup coming if you're paying attention.

Factions form for reasons: booking creates them, workers lobby for them, chemistry develops organically. Some are forced together and never gel. Some are natural fits that become legendary. The system knows the difference.

Roles matter. Leader, enforcer, mouthpiece, workhorse, fall guy. Everyone has a position, and position creates tension. The fall guy wants a push. The enforcer wants respect. The leader wants control. When goals diverge, friction builds.

Betrayal arcs emerge from accumulated pressure. The game doesn't randomly blow up your stable for drama. It waits until the fuse is long enough, then lets you watch it burn.

Collective bargaining is real. Package deals. Road Warriors don't sign without each other. Young Bucks negotiate as a unit. Break the package and you break something that might not heal.

The Freebird Rule works. Rotating champions. Chemistry matrices. Legacy bonuses for legendary stables. Everything a faction should be.

---

### 29. LEGENDARY VENUES REMEMBER

Madison Square Garden remembers what happened there. Korakuen Hall remembers. The Tokyo Dome remembers.

SCS tracks venue history. Major events, title changes, legendary matches, emotional moments: all of it accumulates in the building's memory. Booking a show at a legendary venue means booking inside that history.

Callbacks matter. Return to the site of a betrayal and the crowd remembers. Book a rematch in the same building where the original happened and the stakes feel different. Anniversary shows at historic venues unlock nostalgia bonuses.

Venue prestige affects everything. A title change at MSG means more than a title change at a high school gym. Worker morale spikes when they headline legendary buildings. The crowd arrives with higher expectations and reacts more intensely.

Hometown dynamics matter too. Book a local hero in their hometown and the pop is bigger. Book them losing in their hometown and the heat is nuclear.

Outdoor venues add weather. Rain in Japan. Heat in Texas. Hurricanes in Florida. The game tracks regional climate and applies risk. Some shows become legendary because of the conditions. Some get cancelled.

Buildings aren't backdrops. They're characters.

---

### 30. INJURIES ARE LIVED

SCS doesn't track health as a number that depletes and refills. It tracks bodies that wear down over time.

Every bump accumulates. The game tracks wear by body zone: head, neck, back, knees, shoulders. High flyers burn out their knees. Brawlers accumulate head trauma. Deathmatchers carry scar tissue. The damage is invisible until it isn't.

Painkillers are available. They let workers perform through injury. They also create addiction risk. The more often someone medicates to make the show, the higher the threshold climbs. Some workers become dependent. Some overdose.

Surgery decisions are real. Does the promotion cover it? Does the worker have insurance? Do they have savings? The game tracks healthcare access by region and era. A knee surgery in 2020 America is different from a knee surgery in 1985 Japan.

Style adaptation is survival. Workers can change how they work to extend their careers. The brawler who learns to wrestle slower. The high flyer who grounds their offense. Some make the transition. Some refuse and burn out.

Injuries aren't obstacles to route around. They're stories.

---

### 31. RUNS ON ANYTHING

SCS scales to your hardware. No cloud. No API costs. Everything runs locally.

On a high-end PC, the AI generates promos in worker voices, creates dynamic portraits, and processes complex emotional simulations in real time. Full texture. Maximum depth. ComfyUI running in the background, updating your roster's faces as they age and change.

On a mid-range machine, portrait generation still works but queues more patiently. Promo generation uses lighter models. The simulation runs the same. You're getting the full experience at a slower render pace.

On a phone or older laptop, portrait generation switches to an overlay system. Base portraits with modular layers: scars, wrinkles, weight changes, expression shifts. The faces still evolve. They just evolve through compositing instead of generation. Promos pull from templates with personality modifiers. Core mechanics run clean.

Graceful degradation means you don't need a beast to book. The simulation scales down without breaking. High-end players get generative texture. Everyone else gets the same game with smarter shortcuts.

SCS is designed to run, not to gatekeep. And it's designed to run without your credit card.

---

### 32. MEMORIES THAT MATTER STAY ALIVE

Six years into a save, most games choke on their own history. SCS doesn't.

The memory system uses hydration and dehydration. Relevant memories stay loaded and accessible. Irrelevant memories get compressed and stored. When something becomes relevant again, it rehydrates: a returning legend, a callback feud, an anniversary show. The data was always there. It just wasn't taking up space until you needed it.

This means your save doesn't slow down as history accumulates. Title lineages going back decades. Feuds that ended years ago. Workers who retired before your current roster debuted. All of it exists. None of it drags.

The system decides relevance dynamically. A forgotten midcarder from 1987 stays dehydrated until their protégé wins the world title in 2003 and suddenly the mentor relationship matters. Then it loads. Then the callbacks work. Then the crowd remembers.

You can book for years without the game collapsing under its own weight. History is an asset, not a liability.

---

### 33. PORTRAITS THAT BREATHE

Worker portraits aren't static images. They evolve.

On capable hardware, SCS generates portraits locally using ComfyUI. As workers age, their pictures age. As they gain weight or lose it, their pictures reflect it. Injuries leave visible marks. Morale affects expression. A champion looks different than someone buried in the midcard for three years. Generation happens in the background while you play. No progress bars. No waiting.

On lighter hardware, the system uses modular overlays instead. Base portraits with layered modifications: scar overlays, wrinkle filters, weight adjustments, expression swaps. The faces still change. The method is different.

Either way, you can generate on command. Want to see what a worker looks like with a new haircut? A heel turn wardrobe? Post-injury scarring? Request it. On high-end machines, the AI builds it in seconds. On lower-end machines, you're selecting from a curated set of modifications.

User input works too. Describe what you want: "older, grayer, more tired, scar over left eye." The system interprets and delivers within its capabilities.

Portraits aren't just pictures. They're reflections of what's happened in the game. And they don't cost you a subscription.
