# FINISHER THREAT INDEX

📛 **NAME:** Finisher Threat Index  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Match Engine / Move Credibility  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** finisher, nearfall, kickout, move credibility, finish believability, threat level  
📝 **SUMMARY:**

Tracks how believable each finishing move is as an actual match-ending threat. A protected finisher (One Winged Angel) creates edge-of-seat drama on every use. An unprotected move gets pops for spectacle but no finish tension. This system prevents "nearfall fatigue" where fans stop believing anything will end a match.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**

- Each finishing move has a Threat Index (0-100)
- High Index = fans genuinely believe the match could end
- Low Index = fans pop for the spot but don't believe it's the finish
- Index evolves through: booking consistency, who it's beaten, kickout frequency, context
- Affects: nearfall reaction strength, match drama rating, finish satisfaction

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal. Index tracking is formula-driven.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol. 2 Chunk 10 (locked)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:** [[Match Engine/_Match Engine Index|Match Engine]], [[Crowd_Memory]], [[Predictability_Stakes]]

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**

- Exact formula for index growth/decay
- How quickly does a kickout damage the index?
- Can index be rebuilt after overexposure?

✅ **STATUS:** LOCKED (Vol 2)

## CORE DISTINCTION

| Pop Type | Description | Finish Belief |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Emotional Buy-In** | "He might win right now!" Heart skips, drama hits | HIGH |
| **Conditioned Pop** | "That was a sick spot!" Habit response, no tension | LOW |

---

## THREAT INDEX SCALE

| Range | Status | Crowd Reaction |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 90-100 | Protected Finisher | Nuclear reaction on every use, genuine belief it ends matches |
| 70-89 | Strong Finisher | Very credible, rare kickouts create shock |
| 50-69 | Standard Finisher | Believable but kickouts don't shock |
| 30-49 | Signature Move | Gets pops, not finish belief |
| 10-29 | Transition Move | Nobody expects it to end anything |
| 0-9 | Spot | Pure spectacle, zero finish credibility |

## INDEX EVOLUTION

| Factor | Effect |

## EXAMPLES

| Move | Worker | Index | Reason |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| One Winged Angel | Kenny Omega | 95+ | Rarely kicked out of, every use = drama |
| RKO | Randy Orton | 85 | "Outta nowhere" factor, protected |
| Butterfly Piledriver | Omega | 40-50 | Cool move, fans don't expect finish |
| Canadian Destroyer | Various | 20-30 | Once devastating, now transition move |
| Superkick | Various | 15-25 | Was finisher-tier in 90s, now spam |

## VERSATILE FINISHER TRAIT

Workers with multiple credible finishers (e.g., Bryan Danielson) gain a special bonus:

**Tag: Versatile Finisher**
- Multiple moves can legitimately end matches
- Increases match drama because "any move could end it"
- Harder to predict finish timing
- Examples: Danielson, ZSJ, Kawada, Misawa

## FINISH PATTERN RECOGNITION

| Pattern | Crowd Response |
|---------|----------------|
| "3 kickouts + 1 finisher = actual finish" | Fans time matches, disengage from early drama |
| Flash finishes occasionally | Restores unpredictability, resets crowd trust |
| Countout/DQ surprises | Reshapes future crowd belief in non-pin finishes |

**Example:** Ogawa flash pinning Akiyama for GHC title. Once fans see a major title can fall to a flash pin, ALL future flash pins gain credibility.
