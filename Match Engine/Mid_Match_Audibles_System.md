# Mid-Match Audibles System

📛 **NAME:** Mid-Match Audibles System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Match Engine / Road Agent Subsystem  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** audibles, mid-match, adjustments, signals, earpiece, referee, improvisation, era, promotion  
📝 **SUMMARY:** System for handling live in-match adjustments when crowds shift, injuries occur, or plans need emergency changes. Method varies by era and promotion size: signal-based (old school) vs earpiece-fed (modern corporate). Worker adaptability and referee communication skill determine success. Failed audibles create lasting memory damage.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Two main systems: Signal-Based (70s-90s, small feds) vs Earpiece Live (2000s+, major companies)
- Triggers: crowd burnout, injury, unexpected crowd explosion, external interruption
- Worker Adaptability check determines smooth vs botched execution
- Referee Communication Skill affects message clarity
- World memory tracks legendary saves vs awkward disasters

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (LLM can generate audible dialogue, describe execution quality, narrate crowd response to mid-match shifts)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 837-842

## Core Concept

Not all matches follow the full agented plan. Sometimes crowds shift live, and good promotions adjust mid-match to rescue the show, pop the house, or save face.

How mid-match audibles work depends on:
- Promotion era (1980s vs 2020s)
- Promotion size/budget (small outlaw vs modern corporate)
- Agent experience
- Worker experience/flexibility
- Referee communication tech
- Booking philosophy (script heavy vs call-it-in-the-ring)

## Two Main Audible Systems ✅ LOCKED

| System | Description | Era/Promotion Type |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Signal-Based Audibles** | Visual hand signals, referee whispers, "feel the crowd" code. No tech. | 70s-90s, small promotions, traditional feds |
| **Earpiece Live Feeds** | Referees wired with earpieces. Bookers or agents feed adjustments live during match. | 2000s+ major companies (WWE, AEW, NJPW big shows) |

### Trade-offs

| System | Advantages | Risks |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Signal-Based** | Can create legendary improv moments. Organic crowd feel preserved. | Collapse if workers misread signals. |
| **Earpiece-Controlled** | Surgical adjustments possible. Consistent execution. | Risk losing organic crowd feel. Over-produced. |

## When Mid-Match Audibles Are Triggered ✅ LOCKED

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Crowd Emotional Burnout** | Match planned for epic, but crowd dying by minute 10. Audible to shorten or escalate pacing. |
| **Injury Occurs** | Worker visibly injured. Audible to protect them, end early, or shift story arc. |
| **Unexpected Crowd Explosion** | Worker gets organically hotter than expected. Audible to give them spotlight, victory, push storyline seeds. |
| **External Interruption** | Weather issues, riots, legit fights, fan run-ins. Emergency audible needed. |

---

## Promotion/Era Settings ✅ LOCKED

| Promotion Setting | Mid-Match Adjustment Method |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Old School / Outlaw Spirit** | Signal-based. Referee whispers, gestures, loose codes between veterans. |
| **Modern Corporate** | Earpiece. Agents/booker direct pacing changes live into referee headset. |
| **Mid-Level / Indie** | Mixed. Some refs use hand signals, some may have low-grade comms, high improvisation reliance. |

Era and promotion profile decide which systems are "natural" for that game world.

## What Happens When an Audible is Called ✅ LOCKED

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Worker Adaptability Check** | Workers must pass hidden checks for Composure, Adaptability, and Fatigue. Better workers adjust smoothly, worse workers botch or panic. |
| **Referee Communication Skill** | Good refs convey audibles clearly. Bad refs confuse workers or tip the crowd off. |
| **Match Memory Impact** | Matches that recover beautifully mid-match can create legendary world memories. |
| **Worker Loyalty/Trust Impact** | If a worker feels thrown under the bus by an audible, loyalty/morale can be damaged. |

## Risks of Mid-Match Audibles ✅ LOCKED

| Risk | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| **Crowd Notices** | Sloppy audible execution makes match feel "off." Breaks emotional immersion. |
| **Worker Resentment** | If workers feel blamed or undermined by last-second changes, long-term loyalty/morale scars. |
| **Storyline Drift** | Bad audibles can derail carefully built arcs if not handled emotionally smartly. |

## Example: Mid-Match Audible in Action

**Planned:** 35-min Ironman technical masterclass.

**Reality:** Crowd dead silent by minute 12. Fatigue from earlier chaos matches.

**Referee (earpiece-fed) Audible:** "Go home early. Worker B takes win on sudden roll-up after 15 minutes. Pace fast."

**Outcome:**
- If executed well: Match remembered as gritty "unexpected upset." Crowd surges back emotionally.
- If fumbled: Match remembered as awkward, mechanical. Loyalty loss for booking team.
