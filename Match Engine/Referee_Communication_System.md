# Referee Communication System

📛 **NAME:** Referee Communication System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Match Engine / Staff System  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** referee, communication, audibles, signals, earpiece, betrayal, focus, loyalty  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Referees are living emotional controllers, audible deliverers, and match story enforcers. They deliver mid-match audibles via signals, whispers, or earpieces depending on era/promotion. Referee skill, focus, and loyalty determine whether audibles land cleanly or cause disasters. Rare betrayals possible in advanced drama scenarios.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Three communication methods: Signal-Based, Earpiece Live, Hybrid
- Audible Ability tied to Adaptability (Mental Skill)
- Communication Skill folded into Referee Skill (not separate stat)
- Referee stats: Referee Skill, Focus, Loyalty, Experience
- Mistakes possible: wrong message, late delivery, visible audible, betrayal
- Worker-referee relationships affect audible reception

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** High (LLM can generate referee whisper dialogue, describe audible execution, narrate mistakes or saves)

## Core Concept

In real wrestling, referees are not just counting pins. They are critical emotional controllers, audible deliverers, and match story enforcers.

In SCS, referees will:
- Deliver mid-match audibles (signals, whispers, earpieces depending on era/promotion)
- Influence match outcomes subtly
- Risk making mistakes (bad communication, botched messages)
- Sometimes even betray (if loyalty factors trigger, very rare but huge when it happens)

## Three Communication Methods ✅ LOCKED

| Method | Description | Era/Promotion Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Signal-Based** | Visual gestures, whispered messages. Old-school style. | 70s-90s US, Japan, early ECW, older lucha libre |
| **Earpiece Live** | Ref wired to back. Agents or bookers feed changes in real time. | Modern WWE, AEW, NJPW Dome shows |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of hand signals + live mics. Flexible per worker or situation. | Some modern indies, AEW middle card |

Promotions have internal settings for which systems they primarily use. Some shows (big TV, PPVs) may force earpiece use even in otherwise "signal-based" promotions.

## Referee Stats ✅ LOCKED

| Stat | Role |
|------|------|
| **Referee Skill** | Ability to deliver audibles without confusing workers or exposing the plan to crowd. Includes communication, timing, discretion, positioning. |
| **Focus** | Ability to stay mentally sharp under high chaos. Remembering correct messages, not panicking. |
| **Loyalty** | Referee's loyalty to booker, agent, locker room, or workers. Betrayal risk factor. |
| **Experience** | Veteran refs know how to time audible delivery during natural match lulls (heat spots, corner tie-ups, etc.). |

**Confirmed Design Decisions:**
- Audible Ability tied to **Adaptability** (Mental Skill) ✅
- Communication Skill folded into **Referee Skill** (not separate stat) ✅

## When Referees Deliver Audibles ✅ LOCKED

| Situation | Delivery Method |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Pre-Agreed Signal** | Refs use visual or verbal cue during natural break |
| **Earpiece Command** | Backstage agent/booker sends direct mid-match instruction |
| **Worker-Initiated Inquiry** | Worker quietly asks ref during tie-up ("Are we going home?"). Ref responds based on agent instructions or feel. |

---

## Referee Mistake Possibilities ✅ LOCKED

| Mistake Type | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| **Wrong Message Delivered** | Worker gets wrong pacing adjustment. Match feels awkward or falls apart. |
| **Late Audible Delivery** | Crowd drift becomes irreversible before workers can adjust. |
| **Visible Audible** | Crowd notices ref whispering. Emotional immersion broken, crowd cynicism rises. |
| **Betrayal/Double-Cross** | 🔨 PHASE 2: Ref intentionally screws match finish based on loyalty politics. |

World memory remembers huge ref failures or betrayals. Promotions may fire, demote, or scapegoat refs after major disasters.

---

## Worker-Referee Relationships ✅ LOCKED

| Relationship Level | Behavior |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Trusting Worker** | Smooth audible reception, match saves possible |
| **Distrusting Worker** | Worker may resist audible, freestyle their own finish (high risk) |
| **Star Status Override** | Stars may overrule ref instructions live if they sense better crowd mood (Ego + Psychology check) |

---

## Good vs Bad Referees

| Ref Quality | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| **Good Refs** | Make audibles invisible. Smooth delivery during natural lulls. |
| **Bad Refs** | Cause confusion, awkward pauses, visible talking, breaking kayfabe. |

## Example: Referee Audible in Action

**Situation:** Title match planned for 30 mins. Crowd visibly fading by minute 12. Agent signals ref via earpiece.

**Referee Action:** Ref bumps into Worker A during tie-up. Quietly mutters: "Cut to nearfall sequence. Go home in 3."

**Worker Response:**
- If high Psych/Adaptability/Focus: Adjusts smoothly.
- If low stats: Botches nearfall, crowd notices awkwardness.

**World Memory Impact:**
- If saved well: Match remembered as brave gritty survival.
- If botched: Loyalty drift against promotion/booking exposed.

## Philosophy

> "Referees in SCS aren't scenery. They're living agents of emotional survival or emotional disaster. Their communication skill, loyalty, experience, and focus directly affect whether matches survive drift, crisis, and fatigue."
