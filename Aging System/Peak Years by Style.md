## Overview

Different wrestling styles have different physical demands, which creates variation in when workers reach their peak and how long they can sustain it. High flyers peak early and decline fast; technical wrestlers can work into their 40s. This affects booking decisions, career planning, and roster management.

## Peak Windows by Style

| Style | Peak Start | Peak End | Peak Duration | Notes |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------|-------|
| **High Flyer** | 24 | 32 | 8 years | Speed-dependent, knees/back fail first |
| **Technical** | 26 | 38 | 12 years | Skill-based, longer sustainability |
| **Power/Brawler** | 27 | 36 | 9 years | Strength holds, joints suffer |
| **Striker/Strong Style** | 26 | 35 | 9 years | Stiffness accumulates damage |
| **Submission/Grappling** | 28 | 40 | 12 years | Technique over athletics |
| **Psychology-Based** | 30 | 45 | 15 years | Mind over body, peaks latest |
| **Deathmatch** | 25 | 33 | 8 years | Body accumulates permanent damage |
| **Comedy** | 28 | 50+ | 20+ years | Minimal physical demands |
| **Lucha Libre** | 24 | 35 | 11 years | Aerial demands, mask protects longevity |
| **All-Rounder** | 27 | 37 | 10 years | Balanced, moderate window |

## Style Transition Paths

Workers can extend careers by transitioning styles:

| Original Style | Transition To | Effectiveness |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **High Flyer** | Technical | High (if base skills support) |
| **High Flyer** | Psychology-Based | Medium-High |
| **High Flyer** | Comedy | Medium |
| **Power** | Brawler | High |
| **Power** | Psychology-Based | Medium |
| **Striker** | Technical | Medium |
| **Deathmatch** | Brawler | Medium-High |
| **Deathmatch** | Psychology-Based | Low (body too damaged) |

**Transition Requirements:**
- Base stat of 12+ in new style's key skill
- 6-12 months adjustment period
- Crowd must accept new presentation
- Personality must accept change (Traditionalism check)

## Decline Curves by Style

### Fast Decline (High Flyer, Deathmatch)

```
Skill at Age X = Peak Skill - (Age - Peak End) × 1.5
```

- Rapid drop after peak ends
- Physical stats decline first
- May lose signature moves entirely
- Style change almost mandatory to continue

### Moderate Decline (Power, Striker, All-Rounder)

```
Skill at Age X = Peak Skill - (Age - Peak End) × 1.0
```

- Steady decline
- Can adapt within style
- Experience compensates initially
- Part-time schedule extends viability

### Slow Decline (Technical, Submission, Psychology)

```
Skill at Age X = Peak Skill - (Age - Peak End) × 0.5
```

- Gradual fade
- Mental stats may increase as physical drops
- Can work meaningful matches late
- "Ring general" role available

## Historical Examples

### High Flyer Peak Patterns

| Worker | Peak Start | Peak End | Post-Peak Transition |
|--------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Rey Mysterio** | 23 | 33 | Psychology, technical base |
| **Jeff Hardy** | 22 | 32 | Slowed style, character work |
| **Lita** | 23 | 29 | Retired due to injury |
| **Ricochet** | 25 | ongoing | TBD |

### Technical Peak Patterns

| Worker | Peak Start | Peak End | Notes |
|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Bret Hart** | 27 | 40 | Long technical peak |
| **Kurt Angle** | 30 | 38 | Injuries shortened natural window |
| **Daniel Bryan** | 28 | 38 | Style adaptation extended |

### Psychology Peak Patterns

| Worker | Peak Start | Peak End | Notes |
|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| **Ric Flair** | 28 | 50+ | Legendary longevity |

## Tag Implications

Style tags interact with peak windows:

| Tag | Peak Effect |
|-----|-------------|
| **"Innovator"** | May extend peak through adaptation |
| **"Never Say Die"** | Resists decline, works through limitations |
| **"Style Locked"** | Cannot transition, forced early retirement |
| **"Grounded Veteran"** | Indicates successful high-flyer transition |
| **"Ring General"** | Psychology-based peak, late career |
| **"Body of Work"** | Accumulated damage, shortened window |

## Booking Considerations

### Pre-Peak Workers (Young Phase)

| Style | Booking Approach |
|-------|------------------|
| **High Flyer** | Feature aerial showcase, build crowd connection before body fails |
| **Technical** | Slower build, emphasize learning from veterans |
| **Power** | Build dominance, protect for later |

### Peak Workers

| Style | Booking Approach |
|-------|------------------|
| **High Flyer** | Maximize now, they won't be this good later |
| **Technical** | Feature in long matches, legacy-building feuds |
| **Psychology** | Can afford patient storytelling |

### Post-Peak Workers

| Style | Booking Approach |
|-------|------------------|
| **High Flyer** | Reduced schedule, big match only, style transition |
| **Technical** | Can still work, protect in tag matches |
| **Psychology** | Special attraction, mentor role |
