# Worker Formative Loyalty System

📛 **NAME:** Worker Formative Loyalty System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Contract System / Character Development  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** formative, loyalty, birthplace, debut, built, milestone, trainer, emotional, origin  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Models how the promotion that "built" a worker creates permanent hidden loyalty bonuses. Where a worker debuted, won their first title, had their first major push matters forever. Workers emotionally prioritize their formative promotion even when contracted elsewhere. Betraying formative loyalty without mutual agreements causes scars.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Formative promotions gain hidden loyalty bonuses from debuts, first pushes, milestones
- Trainer/faction loyalty can amplify formative ties
- Fan memory anchoring makes betrayal publicly painful
- Priority layer system (contractual → formative → prestige → event → mutual agreements)
- Talent swap agreements allow priority shifts without betrayal penalties

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (deterministic loyalty calculations; LLM could generate worker reflection on formative years, nostalgic promos)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 5 lines 505-510 (locked)

## 1. HOW FORMATIVE LOYALTY WORKS

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Where They Were Built** | Promotions that debuted the worker, gave first major pushes, forged emotional identity in fans' eyes gain hidden formative loyalty bonuses |
| **Emotional Milestones** | Winning first title, surviving career-defining feuds, hitting first major peaks emotionally deepens ties to formative promotions |
| **Trainer/Faction Loyalty Crossover** | If a worker is strongly linked to a particular trainer, dojo, or faction inside a promotion, that amplifies formative loyalty even further |
| **Public Fan Memory Anchoring** | If fans associate a worker emotionally with a formative promotion, it's harder for the worker to betray that memory without loyalty decay events |

### Formative Loyalty Bonus Sources

| Milestone | Loyalty Bonus |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Debut** | +15 permanent |
| **First Major Push** | +10 permanent |
| **First Title Win** | +15 permanent |
| **Career-Defining Feud** | +10 permanent |
| **First Main Event** | +10 permanent |
| **5+ Years Continuous** | +20 permanent |
| **Trainer Still Active** | +10 while trainer present |
| **Faction Membership** | +5 to +15 depending on faction importance |

### Maximum Formative Loyalty

| Career Path | Maximum Bonus |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Entire career at one fed** | +80 to +100 |
| **Built at one, moved once** | +50 to +70 (original fed) |
| **Journeyman (many feds)** | +20 to +40 (strongest connection) |
| **Mercenary (no deep ties)** | +0 to +15 |

## 2. PRIORITY LAYER SYSTEM

When booking conflicts arise, priorities resolve in this order:

| Layer | Priority | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **1. Contractual Exclusive Obligations** | HIGHEST | Full-time contracts naturally override everything if airtight |
| **2. Emotional Formative Loyalty** | HIGH | Home promotion emotional loyalty heavily biases workers toward prioritizing formative fed events |
| **3. Prestige/Pay Opportunity** | MEDIUM | Bigger promotions may override if emotional ties weak, but only if loyalty or traditionalism scores are low |
| **4. Event Type and Stakes** | VARIABLE | Major anniversaries, title defenses, homecoming arcs spike emotional loyalty temporarily even stronger |
| **5. Mutually Negotiated Talent Agreements** | OVERRIDE | Peaceful handling allows workers to prioritize different promotions without loyalty penalties |

### Layer Interaction Example

**Daniel Garcia booking conflict:**
1. AEW contract (per-appearance, not exclusive) = doesn't lock him
2. Formative loyalty to AEW (built there) = +50 bonus
3. NJPW Strong offers prestige appearance = +30 prestige pull
4. AEW show is anniversary = +25 event bonus
5. No mutual agreement exists = can't freely skip AEW

**Result:** Garcia prioritizes AEW (75 vs 30)

## 3. TALENT SHARING MECHANICS

| Mechanic | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Talent Swap Agreements** | Promotions can form mutual pacts to allow workers to shift show priority for specific events without hurting loyalty or emotional trust |
| **Betrayal Memory Risk** | If talent shift isn't negotiated and forces worker to betray formative loyalty, betrayal memory scars will trigger: hurting long-term loyalty, push performance, or even causing silent crowd disengagement |
| **Respectful Exit Storylines** | If a promotion arranges respectful angles for worker's transition (like farewell matches), emotional scars minimized and world memory preserved positively |

### Talent Agreement Types

| Agreement | Description | Loyalty Protection |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **One-Off Exchange** | Single event appearance swap | Full protection |
| **Tournament Participation** | Worker can compete in partner fed's tournament | Full protection |
| **Developmental Loan** | Young worker trains elsewhere temporarily | Full protection if agreed |
| **Priority Shift** | Worker's primary priority changes to new fed | Partial protection (some fan confusion) |
| **Full Transfer** | Worker moves permanently | Requires respectful exit for protection |

### Betrayal Without Agreement

If a worker is forced to skip formative promotion events without mutual agreement:

| Consequence | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **Formative Loyalty Decay** | -10 to -25 per incident |
| **Betrayal Memory Scar** | Logged in worker's hidden memory |
| **Fan Perception Sour** | Fans at formative fed may turn on worker |
| **Push Performance Drop** | Worker may underperform emotionally at new fed |
| **Future Return Complicated** | Homecoming arcs require redemption |

## 4. HISTORICAL MODELS

| Worker | Formative Loyalty Behavior |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Daniel Garcia** | Built emotionally through AEW. Even if NJPW Strong or WWE NXT offered appearances, Garcia would emotionally prioritize AEW key shows unless respectful mutual agreement allowed schedule shift. |
| **Kenta Kobashi** | Forever linked emotionally to AJPW (early King's Road). Even post-NOAH jump, fans emotionally remember his formative loyalty, and Kobashi himself reflected on it heavily. |
| **Eddie Guerrero (Early AAA/Lucha)** | Emotional ties to early Mexican lucha scene. Though he broke away, formative loyalty shaped later emotional storytelling arcs (Latino Heat evolution). |
| **Mick Foley** | Formative loyalty spread across multiple territories, but strongest ties to ECW (where his legend crystallized). WWF career always carried ECW echoes. |

### Kobashi Case Study

**Formative Promotion:** AJPW (1988-2000)

**Milestones at AJPW:**
- Debut (1988): +15
- First major push (Young Lions): +10
- Triple Crown wins: +15
- Career-defining feuds (Misawa, Kawada): +10
- 12 years continuous: +20
- Faction (Super Generation Army): +10

**Total Formative Loyalty:** +80

**NOAH Jump (2000):** Followed Misawa (emotional anchor), but never fully shed AJPW formative identity. Fans always remembered him as AJPW product first.

**Legacy:** Even decades later, Kobashi's AJPW years define his legend more than NOAH years in many fans' minds.

## 6. PHILOSOPHY

> "Where you were built matters. Not just for your moveset or your style, but for your soul. A worker who was made by a promotion carries that promotion inside them forever. They can leave, they can move on, but the fans remember, and deep down, the worker remembers too. Betray that memory carelessly, and something breaks that's hard to fix."

Formative loyalty creates emotional weight in career decisions. It's not just about contracts or money: it's about identity.
