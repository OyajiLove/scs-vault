## Overview

Desperation Decisions occur when workers are forced to accept bookings, gimmicks, or contracts they would normally refuse because their options have dried up. This mechanic captures the tragic reality of wrestling careers: when financial pressure meets burned bridges meets industry change, even legends compromise their values.

**The Gordy Principle:** A worker who would never accept a cartoon gimmick at their peak will take anything when the money's gone, the bridges are burned, and the bills are due.

---

## Core Formula

```
Desperation Score (0-20) = Financial Pressure + Option Scarcity - Resistance Factors

Capped at 20. Anything exceeding 20 = completely desperate.

If Desperation Score ≥ Gimmick Resistance Threshold → Worker accepts offer
```

---

## Financial Pressure (0-20)

Financial pressure accumulates from multiple sources.

### Ego Baseline (Lifestyle Expectations)

| Ego Score | Baseline Pressure | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| 16-20 | +2 | Needs to maintain image |
| 11-15 | +1 | Some lifestyle expectations |
| 6-10 | +0 | Modest living |
| 1-5 | -1 | Doesn't care about appearances |

### Family Status

**Marital Status:** (tracked field)
- Single
- Married
- Divorced
- Widowed
- Separated

**Dependents Count:** (number, 0-6+)

| Status | Pressure Modifier |
|--------|-------------------|
| Single, no kids | +0 |
| Married, no kids | +1 |
| Married, 1-2 kids | +3 |
| Married, 3+ kids | +4 |
| Divorced, paying support | +3 |
| Divorced, paying support + kids with you | +5 |
| Single parent | +4 |

### Income Status

| Factor | Pressure Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Months without income | +1 per 2 months (max +5) |
| Significant debt | +2 |
| Medical bills (ongoing) | +3 |
| Lifestyle adjustment lag | +1 |
| Savings depleted | +2 |

### Financial Drain Tags

| Tag | Pressure Increase | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| "Big Spender" | +2 per month unemployed | Flashy lifestyle |
| "Road Warrior Lifestyle" | +1 | Hard living on the road |
| "Substance Dependency" | +3 | Habit costs money |
| "Alimony Burden" | +2 | Post-divorce payments |

| "Bad with Money" | +1 | Poor financial decisions |
| "Custody Battle" | +2 | Legal fees + stress |
| "Sole Breadwinner" | +2 | Spouse doesn't work |

### Financial Buffer Tags

| Tag | Pressure Decrease | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|-------|
| "Frugal" | -2 | Lives below means |
| "Smart Money" | -2 | Invested well |
| "Outside Income" | -3 | Business, real estate, etc. |
| "Family Money" | -3 | Inheritance, family wealth |
| "Family Business" | -2 | Non-wrestling fallback |
| "Spouse Works" | -2 | Dual income |
| "Wealthy Spouse" | -3 | Married into money |

---

## Option Scarcity (0-20)

How many doors are closed?

### Market Access

| Factor | Scarcity Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Per major promotion blacklisted | +2 each |
| Entire country/region closed (legal bar, visa, etc.) | +5 |
| Territory system collapsed (era-dependent) | +4 |
| Only 1-2 viable employers remain | +3 |

### Regional Market Modifiers

| Region | Era | Modifier | Reason |
|--------|-----|----------|--------|
| US | Pre-1985 | Low scarcity | Multiple territories |
| US | Post-1990 | High scarcity (+3) | Territories dead, 2-3 majors only |
| Japan | 1980s-90s | Low scarcity | Multiple strong promotions |
| Japan | If banned | Extreme scarcity (+5) | Entire market closed |
| Mexico | Any | Medium scarcity | CMLL/AAA duopoly, but lucha circuit exists |
| UK | 1980s | High scarcity (+3) | Small market, few options |

### Physical Limitations

| Factor | Scarcity Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Physical decline limiting style | +2 |
| Brain damage/cognitive issues | +4 |
| Career-altering injury | +3 |
| Age 40+ | +1 |
| Age 45+ | +2 |

### Reputation

| Factor | Scarcity Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Reputation damage (industry-wide) | +2 |
| Active scandal | +3 |
| "Difficult to work with" reputation | +2 |
| Burned bridges (walked out, shoot incident) | +2 per major incident |

---

## Resistance Factors (0-20, subtracted from total)

What keeps a worker from accepting garbage?

| Factor | Resistance Value |
|--------|------------------|
| Ego 16-20 | -4 |
| Ego 12-15 | -2 |
| Ego 8-11 | -1 |
| Traditionalism 16+ | -3 |
| Traditionalism 12-15 | -2 |
| Financial reserves (savings remain) | -2 to -4 |
| Alternative income source | -3 |
| Pride in legacy | -2 |
| Famous Spouse (options exist) | -2 |
| Wrestling Royalty (can't be truly desperate) | -4 |

**Note:** If resistance is overwhelmed by pressure, it can flip to adding pressure (family needs override pride).

---

## Gimmick Resistance Thresholds

How bad is the offer? Higher number = harder to accept.

| Gimmick Type | Base Threshold |
|--------------|----------------|
| Slight repackage | 4 |
| Midcard role (was main eventer) | 7 |
| Comedy gimmick | 10 |
| Masked/hooded (identity loss) | 12 |
| Jobber role | 14 |
| Humiliation angle | 16 |
| Complete character assassination | 18 |

**Regional Gimmick Context:**

| Gimmick Type | US | Japan | Mexico |
|--------------|-----|-------|--------|
| Masked character | Identity loss (12) | Neutral (8) | Honorable (4) |
| Comedy gimmick | Demeaning (10) | Can be respected (6) | Depends (8) |
| Hardcore/deathmatch | Lowbrow (10) | Legitimate style (6) | Niche (8) |
| Manager role | Step down (8) | Respected transition (5) | Less common (7) |

## The Terry Gordy Case Study

### Career Trajectory

| Phase | Status | Options | Leverage |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Peak (1980s)** | AJPW main eventer, Freebird legend | Japan, territories, anywhere | Maximum |
| **Decline trigger** | 1993 overdose, permanent brain damage | Medical suspension | Collapsing |
| **Blacklist** | Baba fires him, Japan closed | US only | Minimal |
| **Market collapse** | Territories dead, WCW won't hire | WWF or nothing | Zero |
| **Desperation** | 1996 Executioner gimmick | Take it or retire broke | None |

### Gordy's Desperation Calculation (1996)

**Financial Pressure:**

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ego baseline (~15) | +1 |
| Married with kids | +3 |
| Sole breadwinner (assumed) | +2 |
| Years without real income | +4 |
| Medical bills (massive) | +3 |
| Savings depleted | +2 |
| Road Warrior Lifestyle tag | +1 |
| **Subtotal** | **16** |

**Option Scarcity:**

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Japan banned (legal bar) | +5 |
| Territories dead | +4 |
| WCW blacklist (medical liability) | +2 |
| Brain damage limiting work | +4 |
| **Subtotal** | **15** |

**Resistance Factors:**

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ego (damaged, now ~11) | -1 |
| Traditionalism (~12) | -2 |
| Financial reserves | 0 (gone) |
| Alternative income | 0 (none) |
| **Subtotal** | **-3** |

**Gordy's Desperation Score:**
```
16 + 15 - 3 = 28 → Capped at 20
```

**Executioner Gimmick Threshold:** 12 (masked, identity loss)

**Result:** 20 > 12. Accepts the hood.

## Pressure Persistence Categories

Not all pressure decays the same way.

### Recoverable Pressures (decay with income)

| Factor | Decay Rate |
|--------|------------|
| Months without income | Resets to 0 when employed |
| Lifestyle maintenance gap | -1 per month with stable income |
| Debt (non-medical) | -1 per 6 months with income |
| Medical bills | -1 per year with income (very slow) |
| Family pressure | Reduces as bills get paid |

### Sticky Pressures (require specific conditions)

| Factor | Clears When |
|--------|-------------|
| Blacklisted from promotion | Regime change, 5+ years pass, or public rehabilitation |
| Reputation damage | Successful run elsewhere, 3+ years clean |
| Legal bar from country | Legal resolution |
| Industry-wide heat | Major promotion vouches for you |

### Permanent Pressures (never fully clear)

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Brain damage | Physical and cognitive ceiling lowered forever |
| Severe career-altering injury | May adapt, never the same |
| Age | Only goes up |
| Lost prime years | Gone forever |

---

## Pride Ceiling Mechanic

When a worker accepts a desperation gimmick, their Ego takes a hit and gains a **Pride Ceiling**: a cap on how high their Ego can recover.

### The Compromise Scar

| Compromise Severity | Ego Hit | Ceiling Drop |
|---------------------|---------|--------------|
| Slight repackage | -1 | -1 |
| Midcard demotion | -2 | -2 |
| Comedy gimmick | -3 | -3 |
| Masked/hooded (identity loss) | -4 | -4 |
| Jobber role | -4 | -5 |
| Humiliation angle | -5 | -6 |

**Gordy Example:**
- Pre-incident Ego: ~15
- Compromise (Executioner): -4 Ego, ceiling drops to 11
- Post-compromise Ego: 11
- Maximum recovery possible: 11 (not 15)

### Recovery Within Ceiling

Pride recovers slowly with positive events:

| Event | Ego Recovery |
|-------|--------------|
| Steady employment | +1 per year |
| Midcard success | +1 |
| Crowd responds positively | +1 |
| Peer respect (locker room) | +1 |
| Clean living (if substance history) | +1 |

Recovery stops at the ceiling.

### Ceiling Shatter Events

Rare. Requires extraordinary circumstances:

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Unexpected world title run | Ceiling shatters, full recovery possible |
| Career-defining match (MOTY level) | Ceiling +3 |
| Industry-wide redemption narrative | Ceiling +2 |
| Rival promotion bidding war | Ceiling +2 |
| Hall of Fame level late run | Ceiling shatters |

### Multiple Compromises

Each compounds. Ceiling drops further. Recovery gets harder.

| Compromises | Cumulative Effect |
|-------------|-------------------|
| First | Ceiling - severity |
| Second | Ceiling - (severity × 1.5) |
| Third+ | Ceiling - (severity × 2) |

**Pride Floor:** Minimum Ego of 3. Below that, worker has no self-respect left, becomes purely transactional.

### Historical Examples

| Worker | Compromise | Recovery | Ceiling Shattered? |
|--------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Terry Gordy | Executioner | None (died 2001) | No |
| Jake Roberts | Indies, shoots | DDP Yoga, HOF | Partially (legacy, not in-ring) |
| DDP | Late start, "nobody" | World champion at 43 | Yes |
| Mick Foley | Constant bumps | Multiple titles, HOF | Yes |
| Scott Hall | Desperation indies | nWo, then decline | Temporarily |

---

## Out-of-Ring Options Score (0-20)

When a worker refuses a desperation offer, what else can they do?

### Positive Factors

| Factor | Bonus |
|--------|-------|
| Charisma 14+ | +3 (broadcasting, media) |
| Charisma 11-13 | +1 |
| Psychology 16+ | +2 (agent, trainer, booker) |
| Psychology 14-15 | +1 |
| Fame (pop 80+) | +3 |
| Fame (pop 60-79) | +2 |
| Fame (pop 40-59) | +1 |
| "Famous Spouse" tag | +3 |
| "Wealthy Spouse" tag | +3 |
| "Wrestling Royalty" tag | +4 |
| "Heir Apparent" tag | +5 |
| "Family Money" tag | +3 |
| "Family Business" tag | +2 |
| "Outside Income" tag | +3 |
| "Smart Money" tag | +2 |
| Clean reputation | +1 |
| Good industry relationships | +1 |
| Conventionally attractive | +2 |
| Existing media presence | +2 |

### Negative Factors

| Factor | Penalty |
|--------|---------|
| Brain damage/cognitive issues | -5 |
| Severe physical damage | -3 |
| Active scandal | -3 |
| Substance issues (active) | -4 |
| Burned bridges industry-wide | -3 |
| No skills outside wrestling | -2 |
| Charisma under 8 | -2 |
| Regional/language limitations | -2 |

### Out-of-Ring Thresholds

```
If Out-of-Ring Options ≥ 12: 
  → Can refuse and transition gracefully (commentary, agent, business)
  
If Out-of-Ring Options 6-11:
  → Difficult choice. May hold out, may crack eventually.
  
If Out-of-Ring Options ≤ 5:
  → Wrestling or poverty. Ego usually cracks.
```

### Comparison Examples

**Terry Gordy (1996):**

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Charisma ~10 | +0 |
| Psychology (high) | +2 |
| Fame (regional legend) | +1 |
| Brain damage | -5 |
| Physical state | -3 |
| Burned bridges | -3 |
| No outside skills | -2 |
| **Total** | **-10 → 0 (floored)** |

Gordy had nothing. Hood or poverty.

**Kazuchika Okada (hypothetical):**

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Charisma 16+ | +3 |
| Psychology (high) | +2 |
| Fame (international star) | +3 |
| Famous Spouse (actress) | +3 |
| Attractive | +2 |
| Media presence | +2 |
| Clean reputation | +1 |
| Good relationships | +1 |
| **Total** | **17** |

Okada could walk away tomorrow. His ego can stay intact because options exist.

## Retirement vs. Desperation Decision Tree

```
Step 1: Calculate Desperation Score
  → If below gimmick threshold: No offer needed, worker is fine

Step 2: Desperation ≥ Gimmick Threshold?
  → Yes: Offer comes in
  
Step 3: Ego Check (Will pride allow acceptance?)
  → If current Ego ≤ (20 - Desperation Score): Accepts
  → If current Ego > (20 - Desperation Score): Refuses
  
Step 4: If Refuses, check Out-of-Ring Options
  → If Options ≥ 12: Graceful transition/retirement
  → If Options 6-11: Holds out, situation may worsen
  → If Options ≤ 5: Ego usually breaks, accepts anyway
                    OR spiral continues (debt, decline)
                    OR forced retirement into poverty
```

## Mask Drop Mechanic (Lucha-Specific)

For masked workers, the mask IS their identity. Dropping it is a specific desperation decision.

### Mask Attachment Score

| Factor | Attachment Value |
|--------|------------------|
| "Lucha Traditionalist" archetype | +5 |
| Generational mask (inherited) | +4 |
| Mask over 10 years | +3 |
| Mask 5-10 years | +2 |
| Mask under 5 years | +1 |
| High Ego (16+) | +3 |
| High Ego (12-15) | +2 |
| High Traditionalism (16+) | +3 |
| High Traditionalism (12-15) | +2 |

### Mask Drop Threshold

```
If Desperation Score > Mask Attachment → Will consider unmasking for money
```

**Example:**
- Worker with Lucha Traditionalist (+5), 15-year mask (+3), Ego 17 (+3), Traditionalism 18 (+3)
- Mask Attachment: 14
- Would need Desperation 15+ to even consider dropping the mask

El Santo (Attachment ~20): Would never unmask for money.
Mid-level tecnico three months behind on rent (Attachment ~8, Desperation 12): Might take the mask match payday.

## Narrative Applications

### Tragedy Arcs
- Watch beloved worker forced into humiliation
- Crowd memory of peak makes decline painful
- Can generate "save them" babyface sympathy if another worker intervenes

### Redemption Setups
- Desperate acceptance → surprising success
- Worker finds new identity in forced role
- "They took my name, I made the hood legendary"
- Ceiling shatter moment becomes career-defining

### Cautionary Tales
- Young workers see veterans fall
- "Don't burn bridges, don't blow your money"
- Industry memory of falls from grace
- Can affect young worker personality development (seeing what happens)

### Player Moral Choices
- Exploit desperate workers (low cost, but morality implications)
- Offer dignity to fallen stars (higher cost, loyalty reward)
- How you treat desperate workers affects locker room perception

### Monthly Desperation Update

```
For each unemployed worker:
  1. Increment months_without_income
  2. Recalculate Financial Pressure
  3. Check if any Sticky Pressures clear
  4. Update Desperation Score
  5. If Desperation ≥ any available offer threshold:
     → Generate decision event

For each employed worker:
  1. Apply decay to Recoverable Pressures
  2. Check for pride recovery (if below ceiling)
  3. Update Desperation Score
```

---

## Summary

The Desperation Decisions mechanic creates emergent tragedy and redemption narratives by modeling the real pressures that force workers into compromising positions. It respects that:

1. **Financial pressure is real** and compounds over time
2. **Options close** through blacklists, industry change, and physical decline
3. **Pride resists** but can be overwhelmed
4. **Compromise leaves scars** that limit recovery
5. **Some workers have safety nets** (family, fame, skills) and some don't
6. **Extraordinary success can rewrite the story** but it's rare

The Gordy Principle remains: when the money's gone and the bridges are burned, even legends put on the hood.
