## Clause Details

### Push Promise
- **Typical Terms:** 2-4 TV matches per month minimum
- **Variations:** Main event guarantee, PPV appearances, segment time
- **Breach Impact:** 
  - Immediate morale drop
  - Worker may demand renegotiation
  - Union grievance if applicable
- **Who Demands It:** Mid-card wrestlers seeking main event push

### Title Opportunity
- **Types:** 
  - One-time shot within contract term
  - Cyclic (annual title match guarantee)
  - Automatic on specific event (anniversary, return, etc.)
- **Historical Model:** AEW/NJPW deals, guaranteed WrestleMania spots
- **Breach Impact:**
  - Major trust damage
  - Public complaints possible
  - Contract exit clause activation
- **Who Demands It:** Former champions, returning legends, free agent signings

### Creative Control
- **Scope Options:**
  - Full (veto any booking decision)
  - Partial (veto losses, gimmick changes, specific opponents)
  - Limited (final say on major angles only)
- **Historical Model:** Hogan/Nash WCW clauses
- **Breach Impact:**
  - Worker refusal to perform
  - Legal action potential
  - Locker room perception shift
- **Who Demands It:** Top stars with leverage, political operators

#### Creative Control Clause Variants (Vol 5 Expansion)

| Variant | Details |
|---------|--------|
| **Full Term** | Worker can refuse finishes, matches, angles for entire contract. Extremely rare, massive promotion risk. |
| **End-of-Term** | Control activates only during last X days (30, 60, 90). Protects worker on way out. |
| **Exit Negotiation Activation** | If contract ending and not renewed, control activates immediately. |
| **Partial** | Veto only certain match types (hardcore, comedy, deathmatches) but not all finishes. |
| **Conditional** | Only activates under conditions (e.g., "if holding title, must approve finish involving me dropping belt"). |

#### Negotiation Layer

| Point | Options |
|-------|--------|
| **Length** | Whole contract vs final X days only |
| **Scope** | Full veto vs specific match types only |
| **Penalty for Violation** | Automatic release, lawsuit, public scandal threat |
| **Visibility** | Public knowledge (fans/media react if broken) or private |

#### Creative Control World-Bending Effects (Vol 5)

Extreme Creative Control (Hogan-level) doesn't just affect the holder's matches, it reshapes the entire promotion:

| Effect | Simulation Outcome |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Personal Match Protection** | Refuses clean losses, refuses "looking weak" in promos/segments |
| **Gimmick Veto Power** | Can influence or block pushes of perceived threats |
| **Faction/Buddy Protection** | Friends/allies booked stronger; enemies face career sabotage |
| **Storyline Sculpting** | Angles modified mid-planning to center the star's orbit |
| **Recruitment Gatekeeping** | New signees may need political vetting by top guy's camp |
| **Promotion-Wide Stylistic Shift** | Company revolves around "safe style" the star prefers |
| **Resentment Build-Up** | Unprotected workers grow bitter; leads to splits, coups, exoduses |

#### Environment Tilt (Hidden Stat)

Promotions develop hidden "Environment Tilt" toward Favoritism Culture when dominant figures hold extreme Creative Control:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Environment Tilt** | Shifts toward favoritism if CC holder dominates |
| **Fan Awareness Risk** | Perceived manipulation = credibility/ratings loss |
| **Worker Morale Divergence** | Protected group high morale; excluded group collapses |
| **Factionalism Risk** | Political camps form naturally (Hogan camp vs Young Lions) |

#### Historical Examples

| Worker | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Bret Hart (WWF 1996-1997)** | End-of-contract control, ethically invoked |
| **Hulk Hogan (WCW 1994-2000)** | Near-total control, abused to protect spot constantly |
| **Jeff Jarrett (WWF 1999)** | Threatened walkout over final job payout |
| **Ultimate Warrior (WWF 1991)** | Held WWF hostage over main event pay |
| **Scott Norton** | Had gimmick dictated by Hogan's Creative Control reach |

### Favoured Nations
- **Mechanism:** If any worker's pay exceeds yours, yours automatically rises to match
- **Historical Model:** Hall/Nash WCW contracts
- **Consequences:**
  - Salary escalation spirals
  - Locker room resentment from non-favoured workers
  - Financial strain on promotion
- **Who Demands It:** Ego-driven top stars, outsiders demanding respect

### Limited Dates
- **Typical Terms:** 10-50 appearances per year
- **Variations:**
  - PPV-only appearances
  - Seasonal (summer only, WrestleMania season only)
  - Specific events only (anniversaries, championships)
- **Historical Model:** Lesnar, Undertaker, part-time legends
- **Trade-offs:**
  - High per-appearance cost
  - Limited storyline flexibility
  - Special attraction status preservation
- **Who Demands It:** Crossover athletes, semi-retired legends, outside celebrities

### Exclusive Branding
- **Types:**
  - Full likeness ownership (Colt Cabana model)
  - Character name ownership
  - Merch design approval rights
  - Post-departure name retention
- **Historical Model:** Post-WWE name holders (Jon Moxley, etc.)
- **Consequences:**
  - Promotion pays licensing fees for merch
  - Worker controls external appearances
  - Clean exits possible; messy departures have IP battles
- **Who Demands It:** Brand-conscious workers, those burned by previous promotions

## Negotiation Factors

What affects whether clauses are accepted:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Worker Popularity** | High pop = more leverage for demanding clauses |
| **Promotion Financial Health** | Poor finances = less willing to accept costly clauses |
| **Booker Negotiation Skill** | Higher skill = better counter-offers, compromises |
| **Hidden Personality (Ego)** | High Ego workers demand more, harder to satisfy |
| **Hidden Personality (Loyalty)** | High Loyalty may accept less for "home" promotion |
| **Market Competition** | Other promotions bidding = more worker leverage |
| **Recent Performance** | Hot streak = stronger position; cold streak = weaker |

---

## Worker Leverage Tactics (#129)

Workers actively push for better terms during negotiations:

| Tactic | Example | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Ultimatum** | "I'll leave unless you push me as #1 heel" | High risk, high reward |
| **External Offer** | "AEW is offering X, match it" | Forces bidding war |
| **Alliance Pressure** | Clique backs member's demands | Collective leverage |
| **Performance Leverage** | Hot streak strengthens position | Timing-dependent |
| **Media Pressure** | Hint at unhappiness publicly | Burns bridges but creates urgency |

---

## Contract Role Commitments (#129)

Beyond base contract type, some deals include specific booking role commitments:

| Role | Description | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Resident Heel Champion** | Long-term top heel, protected finishes | Rare, multi-year |
| **Touring Heel Monster** | 3-12 month arc, builds babyfaces | Short-term |
| **One-Off Appearance** | Single show, special attraction | One event |
| **Per-Appearance Deal** | Ongoing but flexible, no push guarantee | Variable |
| **Developmental** | Training focus, limited TV | 1-3 years |
| **Part-Timer** | Limited dates, special attraction | Variable |

---

## Roster Change Morale Impacts (#129)

Changes to roster structure affect morale beyond just the workers involved:

| Action | Morale Effect |
|--------|---------------|
| **Breaking Tag Teams** | Both partners lose morale, especially if one is pushed and other buried |
| **Firing Managers** | Stable/faction morale hit, manager's clients feel abandoned |
| **Manager Loyalty** | Strong manager relationships (Cornette, Heenan, Heyman) create deep bonds |
| **Faction Dissolution** | All members affected, some positively (finally pushed solo), most negatively |

---

## Clause Stacking

Workers may negotiate multiple clauses. Common combinations:

| Package | Clauses | Who Gets This |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Standard Star** | Push Promise + Title Opportunity | Upper mid-card, rising stars |
| **Protected Ace** | Guaranteed + Favoured Nations + Creative Control | Top 1-2 in promotion |
| **Part-Time Legend** | Limited Dates + High Per-Appearance + Exclusive Branding | Semi-retired draws |
| **Union Standard** | CBA Minimums + Push Promise + Grievance Rights | Union-covered workers |

## Connected Mechanics

- [[Contract Types]] - Clauses modify base contract types
- [[Contract Morality Score]] - Clause fairness affects morality rating
- [[Worker Resistance]] - Broken clauses trigger pushback
- [[Hidden Personality]] - Ego, Loyalty affect clause demands

## Open Questions

- [ ] Exact success rate formulas for clause negotiations
- [ ] Clause value impact on contract morality score
- [ ] Agent influence on which clauses workers demand
- [ ] Era-specific clause availability (e.g., creative control rare pre-1990s)
