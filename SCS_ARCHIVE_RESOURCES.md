## Usage Strategy

### Don't Mass Upload

The archives are too large for bulk upload. Use surgical targeting:

| Need | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| **Career Arcs** | Pull major years for specific workers (e.g., Bret Hart 1996-1997) |
| **Scandal Deep Dives** | Pull focused clusters (e.g., Bill Watts racism scandal year) |
| **Promotion Changes** | Pull periods of transition (e.g., WCW sale 2001) |
| **Era Research** | Pull decade clumps as needed |

### Batch Upload Guidelines

| Size | Guideline |
|------|-----------|
| **10-15 Observer PDFs** | Perfect for 1 upload batch (~50-80MB) |
| **Big Story Year** | Maybe 1 focused zipped folder per major event |
| **Decade Recaps** | 1-2 targeted zipped pulls if needed |

### Index-First Approach

Use the 236-page Observer Index (1982-2010) as the "table of contents" to identify specific issues needed, then pull only those.
