## Overview

The media landscape changes dramatically across eras. What's possible in 2020 (instant viral exposure) was unthinkable in 1985 (local newspaper coverage). Era Media Landscape defines the rules of media interaction for each time period.

## Era-Specific Mechanics

### Territory Era (1985 Default)

**Scandal Containment:** Very possible
- Local scandals stay local
- Mainstream won't report kayfabe-breaking
- Fed can bury stories

**Pop Growth:** Slow and steady
- No viral moments
- Regional building required
- National exposure rare

**Media Management:** Simple
- Control interviews
- Work with friendly journalists
- Dirtsheets largely ignorable

### Social Media Era

**Scandal Containment:** Nearly impossible
- Everything is instant
- Workers can't be silenced
- Fan archaeology uncovers history

**Pop Growth:** Volatile
- Viral moments create instant stars
- Also instant cancellation
- Constant content required

**Media Management:** Complex
- Every worker is a media outlet
- Fan discourse shapes perception
- Damage control extremely difficult

## Social Media Age Mechanics (#124)

**Core Concept:** "Fans in 2025 care about real-life character, authenticity, and social media presence."

### Era-Sensitive Information Spread

| Era | Information Speed | Containment Possibility |
|-----|-------------------|------------------------|
| **1970s** | Local papers only | Easy to squash |
| **1990s** | Days to weeks | Hard to contain |
| **2020s** | Minutes | Instant viral bomb, impossible to contain |

### Scandal Virality

Same scandal has different impacts based on era:
- **1985:** Local coverage, easily managed
- **2000:** Dirtsheet story, moderate spread
- **2020s:** Viral Twitter outrage, calls for firing, merch sales plummet instantly

### Push Backlash Mechanics

Fast-push with low quality in social media era:
- Fans revolt hard
- Hashtags start (#FireBooker, #WeDontWantX)
- Company forced to respond or double down
- Doubling down risks deeper backlash

### Worker Social Media Tags

| Tag | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **Heavy Social Media User** | Increased chance of social media-based stories, higher scandal exposure |
| **Shuns Social Media** | Won't be involved in social media events, lower scandal exposure |
| **Social Media Savvy** | Can spin narratives, damage control bonus |
| **Chronically Online** | Creates drama, generates heat but risks scandals |

### Sponsor Reactions

| Era | Sponsor Response to Scandal |
|-----|-----------------------------|
| **Pre-1990s** | Mostly unaffected, wrestling had few sponsors |
| **1990s** | Some pullback on major scandals |
| **Post-2000s** | Pull money immediately if scandals taint brand |

---

## Ringstate Considerations

In Ringstate 1985:

| Faction | Media Relationship |
|---------|-------------------|
| **CCA** | Traditional, kayfabe protected, friendly local press |
| **GWA** | Corporate media management, controlled messaging |
| **PWU** | State-controlled media, propaganda |
| **CFPW** | Community media, oral tradition |
| **LGBTQW+** | Underground press, zines, coded communication |
| **Blade** | No official coverage, tape trading, word of mouth |
