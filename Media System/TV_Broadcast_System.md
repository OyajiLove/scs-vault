📛 **NAME:** TV Deal & Broadcast Pressure System  
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Business / External Systems  
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** TV deals, broadcast, ratings, sponsors, networks, timeslots, creative pressure, PPV, streaming, era-based  
📝 **SUMMARY:** Comprehensive system governing how television deals, sponsors, and broadcast relationships create external pressure on booking decisions. Includes era-based evolution from territory pay-to-play models through modern streaming mega-deals, with dynamic ratings tracking and sponsor alignment mechanics.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- TV deals include structural requirements (timeslot, episode count, creative clauses, ratings floors)
- Networks exert creative pressure through feedback, recommendations, and backdoor talent communication
- Ratings are dynamically influenced by fan trust, star power, show pacing, and off-screen perception
- Sponsors have alignment requirements and can conflict with TV network demands
- System evolves based on era and region (1980s territory model vs 2020s streaming deals)
- PPV/broadcast models vary by time period and geography

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal (core logic is deterministic; LLM could generate network feedback notes or sponsor communications)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 4 (locked at line 71113 in tracker)

📎 **CONNECTED SYSTEMS:**
- POP-001: Popularity (ratings drive pop visibility)
- SCAN-001: Scandal System (scandals affect sponsor/network trust)
- FEDER-001: Federation Identity (booking philosophy vs network demands tension)
- ECON-001: Economics (revenue from deals)
- CROWD-001: Crowd Memory (show quality affects ratings)

❓ **OPEN QUESTIONS:**
- Exact ratings floor thresholds for contract termination
- Specific revenue formulas for different deal types
- How quickly sponsor confidence erodes after incidents
- Integration with planned Phase 6 of Booking Engine

✅ **STATUS:** Locked

## 1. TV DEAL STRUCTURE

Each TV deal includes the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Network / Platform** | e.g., USA, TBS, Netflix, New Japan World, FiteTV |
| **Timeslot** | Prime time, late night, syndicated, live or taped |
| **Episode Requirement** | Weekly, biweekly, seasonal arcs, etc. |
| **Creative Clauses** | Family-friendly, no blood, must feature X demographic, etc. |
| **Ratings Floor** | If not met for X episodes, contract is at risk |
| **Revenue Structure** | Flat fee per episode / ad split / viewership bonus tiers |
| **Promo & Media Obligations** | Must make media rounds, do pre-show bites, etc. |
| **Backstage Access** | Some networks may demand cameras, shoot segments, or social exclusives |
| **Renewal Terms** | Early exit penalties or bonus extensions |

---

## 2. CREATIVE PRESSURE SYSTEM

Networks exert pressure through:
- **Feedback notes** (formal recommendations)
- **Mid-season recommendations** (adjustments to booking)
- **Backdoor communication** via agents or top talent
- **Unannounced test segments** (e.g., "Put two influencers in a match and see what happens")

### Consequences of Ignoring Pressure:
- Ratings declines
- Contract termination risk
- Talent alienation (if TV stars feel you're sabotaging them)

---

## 3. DYNAMIC RATINGS SYSTEM

Ratings are influenced by:
- Fan trust
- Star power
- Emotional rhythm of shows
- Match quality vs burnout pacing
- Off-screen perception (union stories, firings, backstage leaks)

### Ratings Drive:
- Sponsor confidence
- Negotiation leverage
- Booking freedom
- Agent/media alignment

**Core Tension:** Every show becomes a balance between "What's best for the story?" vs "What's safe for the deal?"

---

## 4. SPONSOR SYSTEM

### 4.1 Sponsor Types

| Type | Example Brands | Creative Pressure |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Family Brands** | Mattel, Subway | No blood, no swearing, no intergender |
| **Sportswear / Energy** | Reebok, Monster | Push athleticism, wild spots, top physiques |
| **Gaming / Culture** | AEW x Capcom, NJPW x Tekken | Expect cool characters, cult workers, internet synergy |
| **Political / Identity Sponsors** | LGBTQ+ orgs, cultural groups | May push to spotlight specific divisions or themed events |
| **Wrestling-Specific Brands** | Pro Wrestling Tees, Fightful | Low pressure, niche loyalty |

### 4.2 Sponsor Alignment Pressure

| Event | Reaction |
|-------|----------|
| Talent calls out sponsor online | Sponsor may freeze ad runs |
| Promo crosses a line (racist, homophobic, etc.) | Demand apology, suspension, or termination |
| Push union-busting too hard | Progressive sponsors back out |
| High ratings + buzz segment | Sponsor may demand a follow-up or spinoff show |
| Worker becomes crossover star | Sponsor may offer them a solo deal (and push booking around it) |

### 4.3 Sponsor-TV Conflict

Sometimes sponsor and TV partner want different things:
- **TV wants:** Edgy storytelling
- **Sponsor wants:** Clean family brand

**Resolution Options:**
- Side with TV → Sponsor pullout risk
- Side with sponsor → Ratings may stall
- Ignore both → Gain creative freedom, lose money

### Sponsor Feedback Delivery:
- Brand emails
- Network "review calls"
- Top talent reporting what the office is "hearing"
- Agents relaying locker room whispers about commercial money being "nervous"

## 5. ERA-BASED EVOLUTION

### 5.1 U.S. & Global Timeline

| Era | PPV & Broadcast Traits |
|-----|------------------------|
| **Pre-1984 (Territory Era)** | No PPV. TV is loss leader for house shows. Revenue comes from live gates and occasional syndicated tapes. |
| **Mid-80s–90s (National Expansion)** | PPV emerges with WWF's WrestleMania and Starrcade-style events. Monthly PPVs become norm by late 90s. Still reliant on ticket + merch + cable distribution. |
| **2000s (Boom to Collapse)** | WWE & WCW PPV machines dominate. Indies rely on tape/DVD sales or niche streaming. Japan relies on TV + tour model, still no real PPV. |
| **2010s (Streaming Shift)** | iPPV (internet PPV) begins for indies and Japan (e.g., Dragon Gate, DDT). WWE launches Network, replaces classic PPV model with subscription. Mexico begins experimenting (CMLL, AAA with YouTube, Ticketmaster Live). |
| **2020s (Fragmentation + Globalization)** | WWE signs with Peacock (USA) and Netflix (International). AEW mixes PPV and streaming. Indies rely on FiteTV, IWTV, YouTube Memberships, or direct donation models. |

### 5.2 Region-Specific Modeling

| Region | Typical Model (Era Dependent) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **USA** | Classic PPV → Network → Streaming Bundles |
| **Japan** | TV + Tour Gate Model → Some iPPV (NJPW World, Wrestle Universe) |
| **Mexico** | TV-Driven → Slow adoption of PPV, now YouTube Subs, FB Live, or hybrid |
| **UK/Europe** | Late TV uptake → Strong iPPV scene early on |
| **SE Asia / India** | Often free broadcast or digital-only deals |
| **Global Indies** | Patreon, Ko-fi, Bandcamp, Twitch, YouTube paywalls |

---

## 6. PPV MODEL TYPES

Models become available if conditions are met:

| Model | Requirements | Traits |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| **Classic Cable PPV** | USA only, 1985+ | $39.99 price point, needs strong cable deal |
| **Streaming Subscription** | 2010+ | Flat monthly fee, big shows must deliver to retain users |
| **YouTube / Patreon Model** | Any time, any region (if DIY fed) | Small revenue, strong fan loyalty, volatile |
| **No PPV Model** | Common in Japan pre-2010s | Monetize tours, TV rights, DVD sets |
| **Hybrid (AEW Style)** | Modern, any region with reach | Quarterly PPVs + streaming for TV + international subscriptions |

### PPV Success Factors:
- Star power
- Emotional heat on main events
- Fan trust (won't buy if card feels cold)
- Match types (PPVs demand blowoffs or spectacle)
- Production quality (HD, commentary, tech issues = massive variance)

---

## 7. NETWORK PRODUCTION INVOLVEMENT

Some networks handle production themselves:

| Aspect | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| **Camera Quality** | WWE on Fox with 8K cameras, enhanced production |
| **Commentary** | Most Japanese major TV stations provide their own talent to commentate |
| **Branding** | Network graphics, bumpers, sponsored segments |

**Historical Note:** Money follows eras and regions. TV did massive numbers in Japan in the 80s (AJW with Dump and Crush Gals killed it weekly) but promotions often didn't see much of that revenue. Most US territories had to PAY to get on TV and made their money on house shows.

---

## 8. TV DEAL LOSS SCENARIOS

TV deals can be lost through:
- Sustained ratings decline below floor
- Scandals damaging network reputation
- Sponsor exodus forcing network to reconsider
- Talent exodus (e.g., NOAH taking the TV deal when they split from AJPW)
- Financial collapse of promotion
- Network corporate restructuring
