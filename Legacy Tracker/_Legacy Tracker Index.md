# Legacy Tracker

📛 **SYSTEM:** Legacy Tracker
🧭 **CATEGORY:** Career & Recognition
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** legacy, career score, historical impact, HOF eligibility, long-term reputation
📝 **SUMMARY:** A 0-100 score tracking a worker's long-term historical impact and career achievement. Unlike [[Popularity_System|Popularity]] (current fan perception) or [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz]] (short-term momentum), Legacy represents how the worker will be remembered historically.

⚙️ **LOGIC OVERVIEW:**
- Legacy accumulates over entire career, never resets
- Major title reigns, iconic matches, and cultural moments add to Legacy
- Legacy affects [[Hall of Fame/_Hall of Fame Index|HOF Eligibility]], return booking value, and post-retirement status
- High Legacy workers become "legends" with special booking privileges
- Legacy can only decrease through scandal or controversy (rare)

🔬 **LLM INTEGRATION:** Minimal. Legacy is formula-driven. LLM may generate career retrospectives based on Legacy components.

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 6
