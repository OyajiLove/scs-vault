### 📐 Distributed Systems (Scaffolding Complete)

These systems don't exist as standalone modules. Their functionality is distributed across other locked systems. The scaffolding docs map where each component lives.

| # | System | Type | Location |
|---|--------|------|----------|
| 34 | Territory System | Distributed | [[SCS_BIBLE_14_TERRITORY_SYSTEM]] |
| 35 | Media System | Distributed | [[SCS_BIBLE_15_MEDIA_SYSTEM]] |
| 36 | Arena System | Distributed | [[SCS_BIBLE_16_ARENA_SYSTEM]] |

**Territory** components live in: Popularity (regional scores), Crowd Memory (location anchors), Cross-Promotion (territory raids), TV Broadcast (regional deals), Ringstate Factions (territorial claims)

**Media** components live in: Scandal (coverage mechanics), TV Broadcast (media obligations), Popularity (exposure effects), Buzz (virality), Booking Engine (press conference segments)

**Arena** components live in: Crowd Memory (venue memory anchors), Ringstate Factions (venue types), Popularity (regional draw)
