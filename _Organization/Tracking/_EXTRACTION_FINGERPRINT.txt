# 37. Title Run Decay Curve
# 38. Drive/Goal Shift System
# 39. Body Type System
# 40. Loss-Based Character Building
# 41. Booking Pattern Recognition
# 42. Monster Aura Generation

### Cumulative Fatigue System
Post-Match Stamina Penalty based on length, stiffness, bumps, blood
After 8-10 title defenses, workers degrade without rest
Ironmen (Misawa, Kobashi) recover better
"Tournaments organically create legends and tragic heroes"

### Push Organicity Score / Push Authenticity
Fans prefer pushes that feel earned
Force-pushing midcarders to main events risks rejection
"X-Pac Heat" mechanic for undeserved pushes
Era-sensitive: Pre-90s forgiving, 2000s+ highly critical
"MAKE ROMAN LOOK STRONG" type leaks affect perception

### Tournament Burnout Tracker
Spamming tournaments = fan disinterest, locker room fatigue
Cultural exception: Tournament-heavy cultures (G1) have higher tolerance

### Era-Sensitive Fan Logic
1985: Kayfabe, in-ring toughness
2025: Real-life character, authenticity, social media presence
Scandal impact varies by era (70s squashable, 2020s instant bomb)

### Gimmick Fit Formula (LOCKED)
Effective Believability = (Base Believability × Gimmick Fit Modifier) + Random Emotion Surge
85%+ Perfect: +15% Believability
60-84% Good: No bonus/penalty
40-59% Poor: -10% Believability
<40% Disaster: -20% + audience ridicule risk
Example: Steiner White Meat (40%) vs BPP (95%)

### Title Run Decay Curve
"The chase is always easier than the reign"
Momentum of Chase Buff: +10 during chase
Weight of Crown Debuff: Small automatic decay monthly as champion
Prevention: New challengers, instant classics, booking assistant warnings
Babyface champions decay faster, heel champions decay slower

### Drive/Goal Shift System
High Drive: Constantly improves, fights through setbacks
Moderate: Plateaus unless incentivized
Low: Coasts after fame
Very Low: Collapses under success ("could have been" guys)
Nakamura example: Wins title, drive declines, matches get lazier
Crowd and locker room detect "mailing it in"

### Body Type System
Types: Lean, Thick, Soft, Ripped, Giant, Stringy
Impacts: Monster Aura eligibility, match booking logic, visual dominance
Super heavyweight = more joint/hip damage over time

### Loss-Based Character Building
Strong psychology in defeat builds crowd empathy
Desperation/near misses = popularity UP not down
Gutsy fighting spirit triggers small bonuses
Loss Momentum Cooldown: Only so many before fans expect payoff
Legendary Loss Status: Career-defining even if lost (Hardy vs Taker)

### Booking Pattern Recognition
Repeating same show structure = fan engagement drops
Tony Khan repetitive layouts example

### Monster Aura Generation
Menace 16+ (core driver)
Size/Power not laughably low (unless "crazy unhinged" aura)
Charisma/Believability moderate support
Auto-generated based on stats OR weighted chance with compensating tags
Dynamic: Bulks up/works stiffer = gains aura; loses size/exposed = loses aura

# 117. Worker Coasting / Mail It In Mode
# 118. Gimmick Pressure System

### Promotion Exploitation Dynamics
"Big dog abuses little dog" - NJPW to partners, WWF to British indies
Relationship types: Talent Trade, Sharing Pacts, Booking Partnerships, Co-Promotions, Developmental
Disparity matters: Bigger = dominates terms
Leverage factors: Size, Prestige, Promoter Personality, Talent Star Power
Poaching System: Bigger companies scout, tamper, offer deals
Breaking relationships leads to long-term enmity

### Buyouts / Hostile Takeovers (NWA-Style Politics)
Board of Directors voting system
Political Capital pool per promoter
Argument System for title decisions (Talent Value, Business Case, Financial Backing, Legacy)
Buyout mechanics: Big promotions buy up influence until federation collapses/reorganizes
Performance expectations affect political standing

### Scandal Cover-Up / Star Protection Logic
Bigger star = more desperate to cover up
Star Protection by level: Megastar (mountains moved), Main Eventer (strong cover-up), Midcarder (may protect), Low-card (thrown under bus)
Cover-Up options: Quiet cover-up, Public punishment, Defend worker
Era Sensitivity: 70s easy to squash, 2020s instant social media bomb

### PR Fallout System
Fan reaction based on scandal severity + management response
Sponsor reactions: Pull money if tainted (post-90s)
Worker stigma from scandal-associated companies
Promoter personality affects scandal management

### Locker Room Faction Formation
Backstage factions with loyalty tracking
Relationship types: Family, Friends/Allies, Romantic, Rivalry/Hatred, Loyalty (trainer/mentor)
Strength scale: Shallow, Moderate, Deep
Event-driven updates: Betrayals, helping injured friends, morale based on ally/enemy treatment
Influence tags: Locker Room Leader, Clique Member, Shit-Stirrer

### Breakout Performance Triggers
Match exceeds expectations = hidden Career Trajectory Shift
Baseline skills bump 5-10 points over 6 months
Rub Mechanics: Big opponents can elevate you
"Needs Rub" hidden trait
Career Phases: Early Career, Mid Career Opportunity, Breakout Shift, Late Career Drift

### Era-Specific AI Behavior
"Loose Era AI" vs "Tight Era AI" settings
CPU feds rise, fall, betray, panic, dominate organically
Promoter Personality Types: Cutthroat, Pragmatic, Cowardly
Omega in 1985 Mid-South example: Must adapt style or die on vine

### Draft Screen / War Room Interface
Mid-draft AI assistant for suggestions
Prompts like "great heels for surfer sting", "future ace high flyers"
War Room knows promotion style, suggests culturally appropriate picks
Handicap System: Limit calls based on player knowledge
Conflict Alerts for problematic workers

### Cultural Gravity & Style Drift
Each promotion has deep-seated Cultural Gravity pulling toward natural state
NJPW example: 70/20/10 baseline (Strong Style/Storyline/Flashy)
Prevents stupid swerves - NJPW won't suddenly become Crash TV
Booker adaptability affects drift (some refuse to adapt like Vince)

### Goal Shift System (Expanded)
Once goals met, motivations mutate
Post-title low Drive = shorter, safer, lazier matches
Intervention (new challenge, heel turn) can revive motivation
Effort visibility: Crowd/locker room detect "mailing it in"

### Worker Coasting / Mail It In Mode
Low consistency workers "phone it in" on minor shows
Mentorship Revival Option: Locker room leaders can revive lazy workers
Coasting Monster variation: High initial push, low drive, fades without protection

### Gimmick Pressure System
Workers with low Gimmick Fit + High Drive resist their gimmick
May demand meetings, refuse angles, threaten to leave
Ringmaster Austin example: Low believability + high drive/ego = forced change

# 171. Shoot Fighting Ability (Backstage Stat)
# 172. Career Injury Logs
# 173. Wear and Tear Meter

### Draft Rights System
Drafting one tag member reserves right to draft partner next pick
Forfeit = partner free agent + morale penalty
Prevents double-dipping in multiplayer drafts
"You should only get one pick at a time"

### Package Integrity Percentage
Numeric bond strength: Road Warriors 95%, Smoking Gunns 60%
Higher = stronger splitting consequences
Manager links also have integrity ratings (Cornette to Midnights)

### Match Length Psychology Gate
"Omega in Japan 30+ min vs USA 15 min TV hits different"
TV Sprint (10-15 min) = limited psychology
PPV Standard (15-25 min) = moderate story beats
Epic Format (30-45+ min) = full fighting spirit, exhaustion arcs
TV Match Optimization vs Epic Match Capability ratings

### Non-Popup Narrative Feedback
Replace gamey counters with organic dialogue
"hey, this guy has lost valiantly 10 times in a row. it's stale."
Penalties increase silently as you ignore
Booking team/agents convey through natural dialogue

### System Priority Pyramid
Hierarchy: 1. Story First, 2. Worker Performance, 3. Chemistry, 4. Variance
Chemistry is "spice, not the meal"
Enhances stories, doesn't replace them
"Protects the player's joy"

### Default to Good Enough Principle
"Two good workers should still have good matches by default"
No random bad chemistry nonsense
Only surface chemistry for notable positive OR disastrous cases

### Coachability Attribute
Distinct from Drive: how well worker listens, learns, absorbs training
"Some workers train, listen, learn. Some don't."
High Drive + Low Coachability = works hard but repeats mistakes

### Needs Rub Hidden Trait
Hidden flag: worker needs big opponent to elevate them
DDP needed Savage; Kawada needed Misawa
Triggers Rub Mechanics when matched with stars
Workers may stall indefinitely without proper booking

### Personal Priority Traits / Outside Interests
Workers have non-wrestling passions competing with career
Sid's softball example: "legit just fuck off and play softball"
High Outside Interests may cause no-shows
Fans may find it charming (cult status) or resent (momentum loss)
Brock Lesnar hunting, workers with acting careers

### Promo Style Tags
Righteous Fury (Sid, Warrior, peak Cena)
Dangerous Madman (Steiner, Terry Funk, Moxley)
Smooth Operator (Flair, Rock, early Shawn)
Snarky Wit (MJF, Punk, Heenan)
Rugged Everyman (Dusty, Foley, Eddie Kingston)
Book the KIND of promo, system interprets worker ability

### Booker Adaptability Rating
How bookers respond to crowd feedback
High Adaptability (TK): pivots based on feedback, adjusts pushes
Low Adaptability (Vince/Dusty): doubles down, ignores rejection
"TK pivots a lot based on feedback, which is usually great"
Stubborn bookers risk death spiral, fed reputation tanks

## SECTION M: CHUNK 05 EXTRACTION (Items 174-188 + HB-38)

# 187. Historical Database 1983 Starting Point
# 188. Entertainment Calibration Locked Examples (Vader, Sid, Luger, Steiner, Bret, Misawa, Jumbo, Inoki, Santo, Cena 2013)

### Chunk 05 Half-Baked
# HB-38. 1996 HBK Entertainment Calibration (Partial - cuts off) - RESOLVED into #190

### Post-Extraction Additions (#189-191)
# 189. Range Stat Addition (Entertainment Category) - NEW STAT
# 190. HBK 1996 Entertainment Calibration (Complete) - resolved from HB-38
# 191. Updated Entertainment Calibrations with Range

### Range Stat (NEW - Item #189)
Definition: How broad a character swath a worker can convincingly cover
Distinct from Believability (authenticity) - Range = dramatic versatility
18-20: Transformative genius (Mick Foley)
15-17: Very versatile (Rock, Jericho, Eddie)
12-14: Solid range (HBK, Dusty, Sting)
8-11: Limited but functional (Bret, Taker, Cena)
4-7: Very narrow, one mode (Vader, Hansen, Goldberg)
1-3: Virtually no range
Key Insight: Low range isn't bad - Hansen/Vader didn't need it

### Updated Entertainment Category (6 stats)
Charisma, Believability, Promo Skill, Menace, Sex Appeal, Range

### HBK 1996 Complete Calibration (#190)
Charisma 18, Believability 15, Promo Skill 16, Menace 7, Sex Appeal 20, Range 14

### Full Calibration Table with Range (#191)
Vader: 17/19/13/20/2/5 | Sid: 18/19/9/20/14/6 | Luger: 15/10/9/15/18/7
Steiner BPP: 19/18/7/19/15/8 | Bret: 16/19/14/11/16/10
Misawa: 13/19/7/9/11/6 | Jumbo: 16/18/11/14/8/7 | Inoki: 20/20/17/13/14/12
Santo: 16/18/11/7/14/9 | Cena 2013: 19/12/15-16/13/18/9
HBK 1996: 18/15/16/7/20/14 | Mick Foley peak: 15/18/17/16/4/20

### Wear and Tear Visibility Framework
No hard numbers by default - surfaced naturally through:
- Profile status: "Currently healthy" to "Severe long-term wear threatening career"
- Match reports: "Worker X appeared visibly slower and favored his right knee"
- Backstage reports: "Road Agent notes Worker Y is struggling to recover"
- Optional medical exam: Deeper analysis in natural language
- Commentary hints: Announcers noting physical issues

### Medical Exam System
Full decision flow: Initiate exam -> Results returned -> Player decision -> Worker reaction -> World fallout
Worker reactions based on personality: Driven to Destruction, Fragile/Lazy, Loyalist, Bitter
Kurt Angle 2005 example: Painkiller addiction arc from refusing time off

### Relationship Timeline System
Relationships evolve over time with historical checkpoints
Punk/Colt example: 2003 Best Friends -> 2016 Fallen Friends -> 2020 Active Rivalry
Tag updates: Best Friends to Fallen Friends, Mentor to Betrayed Mentor

### Kayfabe vs Real Separation
Kayfabe storylines (booking) vs Real relationship shifts (backstage events)
Critical distinction to prevent nonsensical outcomes

### Kohai/Sempai Loyalty
Cultural weight for mentor relationships
Leaving sempai's promotion = Mentor Loyalty Broken trigger
Stronger bonds in Japan vs West, era-dependent

### Personality Category Lock
Professionalism, Ego, Temperament, Loyalty, Drive
"Mental = how you think in violence. Personality = how you survive and scheme backstage."

### Jobbing Willingness Formula
Multi-factor: Professionalism + Ego + Relationship + Opponent Star Power + Stakes + Culture
Claudio/Cole example: Friends + equal stars = flash pin accepted

### Conditional Finish Protection
Kick Out at 3.1 NOT automatic - conditional on opponent, relationship, stakes, culture
Hogan vs Kidman example: Never clean loss to midcarder

### Match Dominance Impact
Non-monsters dominating 80-90% = psychology penalty
Monster Aura workers exempt
Agent skill can mitigate

### Entertainment Category Lock
Charisma, Believability, Promo Skill, Menace, Sex Appeal
Menace = aura + body language + violence potential + psychological predation

### Physical Stat Consolidation
Agility/Speed merged into single "Agility (Unified)"
Physical block: Strength, Agility, Stamina, Durability

### Size/Frame Composite
Height + Weight + Body Type = Size/Frame (hidden composite)
Body Types: Lean, Thick, Soft, Ripped, Giant, Stringy

### Historical Database 1983
Ideal starting point for historical mode
Death of territories, NWA confederation, insane talent pool
Timeline modes: Realistic, Sandbox, What-If

### Entertainment Calibration Examples
Vader: 17/19/13/20/2 | Sid: 18/19/9/20/14 | Luger: 15/10/9/15/18
Steiner BPP: 19/18/7/19/15 | Bret: 16/19/14/11/16
Misawa: 13/19/7/9/11 | Jumbo: 16/18/11/14/8 | Inoki: 20/20/17/13/14
Santo: 16/18/11/7/14 | Cena 2013: 19/12/15-16/13/18

### Design Insights from Chunk 05
"Charisma ≠ Flamboyance" - Bret, Misawa, Santo had quiet charisma
"Menace Must Be Mythic" - Vader, Sid, Steiner need 19-20
"Promo Skill ≠ Connection" - Sid, Steiner connected despite "bad" promos
"Sex Appeal Is Market-Specific" - Bret huge with women, Vader 2, Rock 20

### Storyteller Archetype Discussion (#225)
Mostly serves as HYBRID LAYER over other archetypes
