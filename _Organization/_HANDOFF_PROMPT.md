## For Next Chat Session
**Date:** 2024-12-23
**Status:** Chunks 01-10 Complete, Fingerprint Merge Pending

---

## QUICK CONTEXT

We're extracting mechanics from Volume 1 of the SCS design documents. This is line-by-line extraction work, cataloging every locked system, mechanic, calibration, and half-baked idea into a master fingerprint file for Ctrl+F reference.

**Volume 1** = Foundation document covering worker skills, archetypes, booking systems, and core philosophy.

## CURRENT STATE

### ✅ COMPLETED
- **Chunks 01-08:** 232 items extracted and written to fingerprint
- **Chunks 09-10:** 38 items + 3 HB fully extracted to `_CHUNK_09_10_EXTRACTION.md`
- **Total documented:** 311 items (270 numbered + 41 half-baked)

### ⏳ PENDING
- **Merge Task:** Append Section Q from `_CHUNK_09_10_EXTRACTION.md` to `_EXTRACTION_FINGERPRINT.txt`
- The fingerprint file currently ends at item #232 (Section P: Chunk 08)
- Need to add items #233-270 and HB-42 to HB-44
- Update grand totals from 228 to 311

## IMMEDIATE TASK

```
1. Read _EXTRACTION_FINGERPRINT.txt (ends at #232)
2. Read _CHUNK_09_10_EXTRACTION.md (has Section Q content)
3. Append Section Q to fingerprint file (items #233-270, HB-42-44)

5. Verify merge successful
```

## AFTER MERGE - OPTIONS

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | Move to Volume 2 extraction |
| B | Final Vol 1 consolidation pass (check for any missed items in chunks) |
| C | Start building archetype database structure (JSON schemas) |
| D | Create individual archetype files in Obsidian vault |

---

## TOOL USAGE REMINDER

**CRITICAL:** Always use lowercase `filesystem:` tools, NEVER uppercase `Filesystem:`

| Tool Prefix | Access |
|-------------|--------|
| `filesystem:` | Full Z:\ and C:\ access ✅ |
| `Filesystem:` | Restricted, will FAIL on Obsidian vault ❌ |

---

## COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES

- Direct and honest, no sugarcoating
- Socialist lens, philosophical depth without pretension
- Gen Z humor without cringe
- Never use em dashes (use commas, colons, parentheses)
- Cross-reference past work to avoid drift
- If guessing, say so explicitly

---

## PROJECT PHILOSOPHY

**Squared Circle Soul** = Wrestling booking simulator where storylines emerge organically from system interactions

**Core Principle:** "Beauty in Struggle" - the chase is more beautiful than the reign, heroism is forged in scars not smiles

**Design Rule:** Every archetype has mandatory core skills (no exceptions). Without core skills, you're just cosplay.

---

## SAMPLE START MESSAGE

```
Continuing SCS Vol 1 extraction. Chunks 09-10 are done but need merging into the main fingerprint file.

Task: Append Section Q (items #233-270 + HB-42-44) from _CHUNK_09_10_EXTRACTION.md to _EXTRACTION_FINGERPRINT.txt, then update totals.

After that, [pick A/B/C/D or give me direction].
```

**May your booking be logical, your crowds engaged, and your wrestlers over. 🤝**
