---

## ITEM #94
**DESTINATION:** Promotion Relationships / Inter-Promotional System
**CONTENT:**
Promotion Exploitation Dynamics (Locked):

Core Concept:
"Big dog abuses the shit out of little dog. NJPW to so many promotions in the 90s and 00s, WWF/E to the British indie scene, AEW kinda dominating NJPW and CMLL tho giving something in return."

Relationship Types:
- Talent Trade Agreements
- Talent Sharing Pacts
- Booking Partnerships
- Co-Promotions
- Developmental Deals

Disparity Matters:
"If one promotion is way bigger (in size, prestige, financial clout), they dominate the relationship terms. If relatively even, true mutual partnerships possible (rare)."

Promoter Personality Matters:
| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Cutthroat (Vince, Choshu, Baba late 80s) | Exploitative deals |
| Pragmatic (early AEW, Misawa) | More fair terms |
| Passive or desperate | Get eaten alive |

Risk/Reward for Smaller Companies:
**Pros:**
- Boosted exposure (your guys wrestle bigger names, get noticed)
- Shared media access (bigger TV networks)

**Cons:**
- Risk of your champions jobbing to outsiders
- Risk of talent being scouted and poached

---

## ITEM #95
**DESTINATION:** Show Booking / Arena System
**CONTENT:**
Weather / Outdoor Show System (Locked):

Core Concept: Any venue classified as "Outdoor Stadium" without a retractable roof or full cover is exposed to the elements.

Regional Weather Tables:
| Region/Season | Weather Risk |
|---------------|-------------|
| Florida in July | 80% humidity, daily rainstorms |
| Arizona in August | Dry but 110°F |
| Northeast US in March | Snow or cold rain risk |
| Japan in June | Rainy season |
| Texas in July | Brutal heat |

Weather Effects:
| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Light Rain | Minor slip risk on stage/ramp. Lowered fan energy. High flyers suffer small grade penalty. |
| Heavy Rain | Mat becomes slick. Workrate heavily impacted. Risk of match accidents rises. |
| Thunderstorms | If lightning is near, legal liability = instant show stoppage risk. Potential match cancellations. Refund nightmares. |
| Extreme Heat | Worker stamina decays fast. Heavyweight brawlers suffer. Injuries from dehydration spike. |
| Cold Weather | Mat and ropes get stiffer, workers risk pulls and tears. Cold crowds = less energy = worse pops. |

Ring Protection Option:
"When booking an outdoor stadium without a full dome, you get an optional pre-show decision: Do you pay to erect a scaffolding/rain covering over the ring? Or do you leave it exposed to the elements?"

## ITEM #107
**DESTINATION:** Promotion Relationships / Territory System
**CONTENT:**
Promotion Exploitation Dynamics (Expanded):

Power Dynamics:
| Power Level | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| Dominant | Sets terms, takes best talent |
| Equal | Negotiates fairly, mutual benefit |
| Subordinate | Accepts scraps, hopes for growth |

Benefits vs Risks:
| For Smaller | Benefit | Risk |
|-------------|---------|------|
| Exposure | Your guys on bigger stage | They get poached |
| Credibility | Association with big names | Your titles devalued |
| Growth | Can expand to new markets | Risk of talent being scouted and poached |

Poaching System (LOCKED):
- Bigger companies scout your workers
- If they see potential or value (fan buzz, killer matches, good looks), they offer deals or outright tamper
- Strong contracts and loyalty stats slow it down but don't stop determined poachers

Breaking Relationships:
Bad blood (betrayal booking, poaching, sabotage) leads to:
- Talent sharing collapse
- Public fallout
- Long-term enmity (won't work together for years)

Key Law: "YES: Big Dog abuses Little Dog unless Little Dog gets really clever or really lucky."

---

## ITEM #108
**DESTINATION:** Promotion Relationships / Territory System
**CONTENT:**
Buyouts & Hostile Takeovers (NWA-Style Politics) (Locked):

NWA-Style Governing Body:
"Promotions can join Federations (NWA, etc.). Some belts (World Title, Tag Titles) are jointly owned by the federation, not individual promotions."

Board of Directors / Council Votes:
| Aspect | Mechanics |
|--------|----------|
| Voting Weight | Based on promotion size, prestige, financial contributions, political leverage |
| Title Decisions | Board votes on who wins and when |
| Champion Selection | Bigger companies have more say |

Political Capital System (LOCKED):
"Every promoter has a 'Political Capital' pool (reputation, favours owed, financial influence)."

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Pushing a candidate for a belt | Burns political capital |
| Making enemies | Loses political capital |
| Winning politically | Gains temporary power, but at long-term risks (resentment, isolation) |

Argument System (LOCKED):
Before a major title decision, players present an "Argument" to the board:
| Argument Type | Example |
|---------------|--------|
| Talent Value | "Terry Funk can represent our brand with toughness and realism!" |
| Business Case | "Funk draws houses across the South and Japan." |
| Financial Backing | "We pledge to front travel costs." |
| Legacy Appeal | "Funk Family has history, prestige, loyalty." |

Dynamic Personality Reactions:
| Personality Type | Reaction |
|-----------------|----------|
| Paranoid, selfish promoters | Resist |
| Pragmatic promoters | Can be won over with logic or cash |
| Old school promoters | May favour bloodlines, tradition |
| Cutthroat promoters | Will nod yes and immediately start sabotaging you later |

Buyout Mechanics (LOCKED):
"Big promotions (Crockett, WWE) can slowly buy up other members' influence. When critical mass is reached, federation collapses or reorganizes under new leadership."

Example: "You are no longer the NWA... you are now World Championship Wrestling."

Performance Expectations:
| Outcome | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Your guy wins the belt and draws badly | The board forces a quick drop |
| Your guy overperforms | You gain massive political capital and might dictate multiple title runs afterward |
