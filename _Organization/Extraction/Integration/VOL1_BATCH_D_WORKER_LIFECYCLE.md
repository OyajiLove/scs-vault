## ITEM #38
**DESTINATION:** HIDE-001 or WKR-001 → Career Evolution
**CONTENT:**
Drive / Goal Shift System (Locked):

Core Concept: Once goals are met (titles, respect, money), motivations mutate.

Drive Attribute Effects:
| Drive Level | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| High Drive | Constantly improves, seeks opportunities, fights through setbacks |
| Moderate Drive | Plateaus at realistic level unless incentivized |
| Low Drive | Coasts after fame, mentally checks out |
| Very Low Drive | Collapses under success, "could have been" guys |

Goal Shift Mechanic:
| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|----------|
| Chase dream achieved | May shift to "coast and vibe" mode |
| Post-title win, low Drive | Matches become shorter, safer, lazier |
| Intervention (new challenge, heel turn) | Can revive motivation |

Example: Nakamura (Locked):
- Wins top title
- Drive stat naturally declines
- Matches become shorter, safer, lazier
- Fans slowly feel it: "Nakamura still has star aura, but matches aren't what they used to be."
- Without intervention, coasts and fades from top draws

Effort Visibility: Crowd and locker room can tell if worker is "mailing it in" - fans get restless over time.

## ITEM #109
**DESTINATION:** Scandal System
**CONTENT:**
Scandal Cover-Up & Star Protection Logic (Locked):

Core Law (User-Locked):
"The bigger the star = the more desperate promoters will be to cover up, excuse, or bury scandals. Small fry = immediately sacrificed."

Star Protection Logic:
| Star Level | Response |
|------------|----------|
| Megastar (Hogan-tier) | Will move mountains to protect, cover up |
| Main Eventer | Strong cover-up attempts, high-risk PR plays |
| Midcarder | May protect if politically connected |
| Low-card / Nobody | Immediately thrown under the bus |

Cover-Up System (Locked):
When a scandal breaks, you can choose:
| Option | Outcome |
|--------|--------|
| Cover it up quietly | Success depends on era (easier pre-90s, harder post-Internet) |
| Publicly punish (fire/suspend) | Fast resolution, lower backlash |
| Defend the worker | Bad PR risk, but keeps star |

Cover-Up Costs More for Stars:
- It's harder and more costly to bury a top guy's scandal successfully
- If caught defending a major creep, blowback is 100x worse because fans/media view it as "systemic rot"

Era Sensitivity (Locked):
| Era | Scandal Difficulty |
|-----|--------------------|
| 1970s Amarillo | Easy to squash |
| 1990s WWF | Hard to contain |
| 2020s AEW/NJPW | Instant social media bomb |

Historical Examples:
- Hogan steroid cover-ups
- Snuka murder cover-up
- Modern SpeakingOut buried names

Final Law: "Promoters love money. They will burn morality on the altar of box office... or burn so many bridges you die isolated. (Just like real life.)"

| Workers associated with scandal-tainted companies | Gain "stigma" debuff (hurts value if they move) |

Promoter Personality Impacts Scandal Management:
| Type | Response |
