## ITEM #81
**DESTINATION:** Era System / Worker Stats
**CONTENT:**
Era Adaptability / Random Debut System (Locked):

Purpose: For freaks who want Kenny Omega debuting in 1983 Mid-South or Ric Flair debuting in 2014.

Core Stat: Era Adaptability Rating
"Measures how well a worker's style fits different eras and whether they can adjust."

How It Works:
| Worker Type | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| High Era Adaptability (Vader, Jericho) | Can adapt to any era, learns to adjust style |
| Low Era Adaptability (Omega in 1984 Crockett) | Disaster unless they shift style |

In Practice: Omega Drops Into 1985 Mid-South:
```
Omega drops into 1985 Mid-South Wrestling:
- Tries his usual high spot sequences
- Crowd confused or booing "phony wrestler" vibes

Omega can:
- Shift style (learn to sell more, work gritty, minimize motion) → Crowd accepts
- Refuse to adapt → Die on the vine
```

Era-Appropriate Psychology Meter:
"High spot fests might die in 1980s NWA. Gritty selling and minimalism scores higher."

Fanbase Cultural Expectations (by Era/Region):
| Era/Region | What Fans Want |
|------------|---------------|
| '80s Southern US | Realism and blood |
| '90s Japan | Pure workrate |
| 2020s US | Storytelling + workrate + meme moments |

Era Correction Factor:
"Adjust how fans perceive certain traits (size, charisma, workrate) based on year and region. Fans care about different things."

Example: "Hulk Hogan = max believable babyface for 1985 WWF fans, less so by modern standards."

## ITEM #113

| National Expansion (80s-90s) | Aggressive talent raids, TV focus |
| Monday Night Wars | Hot-shot booking, swerves, star-making pushes |
| Ruthless Aggression | Edgy content, rapid title changes |
| PG Era | Safe booking, long reigns, brand splits |

## ITEM #114
**DESTINATION:** Draft System
**CONTENT:**
Draft Screen / War Room Interface (Locked):

2. War Room suggests 5-15 relevant picks
3. Click to open profile quick views (stats, personality, history, injury risks)
4. Make informed pick without panicking

## ITEM #162
**DESTINATION:** Booker/Promoter System
**CONTENT:**
Booker Adaptability Rating:

Core Mechanic: Formal attribute measuring how bookers respond to crowd feedback.

Examples:
- High Adaptability (TK type): Pivots based on fan reaction, adjusts pushes, listens to feedback
- Low Adaptability (Vince/Dusty type): Doubles down on vision, ignores rejection, risks death spiral

System Effects:
- Adaptable bookers get soft suggestions: "Fans are hijacking the show for Takeshita. Consider adjusting plans."
- Stubborn bookers see worker momentum tank faster, fed reputation for "pushing wrong people" grows
- Cultural Gravity can resist even adaptable bookers if changes are too extreme

Key Quote: "TK pivots a lot based on feedback, which is usually great... Whereas most bookers are assholes and think they know better."
