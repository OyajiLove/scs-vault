## 🚶 META: ERGONOMICS NOTE

**HB-41: Walking Pad Ergonomics for Dev Work**

Recommended Schedule for 200-300 hour project:
| Phase | Duration | Strategy |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Standing | 30-45 min | Keeps blood moving, don't lock knees |
| Walking | 15-30 min | 1.5-2.0 mph after sitting/standing |
| Sitting | 45-60 min max | Rest after standing + walking |
| Breaks | Every 60-90 min | 5 min move/stretch, hydrate |
| Full Reset | Every 3-4h | 15-20 min real break, go outside |
| Daily Max | 2-4h focused | Quality over quantity |

Key Insight: "Grinding 8-10h a day will destroy quality and motivation."
