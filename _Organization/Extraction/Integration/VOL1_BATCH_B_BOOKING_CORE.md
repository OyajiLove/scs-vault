## ITEM #32
**DESTINATION:** BOOK-001 (Booking_Engine.md) → Fatigue System
**CONTENT:**
Cumulative Fatigue System (Locked):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Match Length Impact | Longer matches = more fatigue buildup |
| Style Intensity | High-impact styles accumulate faster |
| Recovery Time | Required between major matches |
| Visible Effects | Performance degrades, injury risk rises |

Tournament Context:

- Smart booking includes rest periods

---

## ITEM #33
**DESTINATION:** POP-001 (Popularity.md) → Push Mechanics
**CONTENT:**
Push Organicity Score (Locked):

Core Concept: "Fans prefer pushes that feel earned (gradual buildup, major feuds won). Shoving a midcarder to main events instantly can backfire unless they crush it in matches/promos."

In Practice:
- Gradual rise = organic, fans accept
- Sudden rocket push = scrutiny, must prove themselves
- Failed rocket push = backlash, "forced" label

Era Sensitivity:
- Modern fans (2020s) more skeptical of corporate pushes
- Territory era fans accepted quick rises if worker delivered

---

## ITEM #34
**DESTINATION:** BOOK-001 (Booking_Engine.md) → Tournament System
**CONTENT:**
Tournament Burnout Tracker (Locked):

Core Concept: "Promotions spamming tournaments see fan disinterest, locker room fatigue, reduced buys unless culturally appropriate."

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Tournament Frequency | Too many = diminishing returns |
| Cultural Context | Japan tolerates more tournaments than US |
| Stake Clarity | Clear stakes maintain interest |
| Worker Recovery | Ignored fatigue tanks match quality |

---

## ITEM #35
**DESTINATION:** Crowd Memory / Era System
**CONTENT:**
Era-Sensitive Fan Logic (Locked):

Core Concept: Different eras have different fan expectations and tolerance levels.

| Era | Fan Logic |
|-----|-----------|
| 1970s-80s | Accept authority, trust booking |
| 1990s | Rebellious, reject "corporate" picks |
| 2000s-10s | Workrate-conscious, internet-informed |
| 2020s | Hyper-aware, meta-ironic, hashtag-ready |

Push Authenticity Modifier:
- Same push in different eras = different reception
- Forced pushes punished harder in modern era

---

## ITEM #37
**DESTINATION:** BOOK-001 or Title System
**CONTENT:**
Title Run Decay Curve (Locked):

Core Concept: "The chase is always easier than the reign."

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Momentum of the Chase Buff | +10 momentum bonuses during chase |
| Weight of the Crown Debuff | Small automatic decay every month as champion |

Decay Prevention Methods:
- New hot challengers emerge
- Big matches redefine reign (instant classics)
- Booking assistant warnings: "The crowd loves [worker], but they're starting to crave something new."

Alignment Difference:
| Alignment | Decay Rate |
|-----------|------------|
| Babyface Champions | Struggle to stay hot, faster decay |
| Heel Champions | Decay slower (easier to hate), unless too cowardly/boring |

Success Example: Okada 2016-18: Fought decay successfully, created dynasty.

---

## ITEM #40
**DESTINATION:** BOOK-001 or Feud Memory
**CONTENT:**
Loss-Based Character Building (Locked):

Core Concept: Losses can build momentum when handled right.

Match Storytelling Engine:
| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Strong Psychology in Defeat | Builds crowd empathy |
| Desperation/Near Misses | Popularity ticks UP, not down |
| Gutsy Fighting Spirit | Triggers small bonuses |

Loss Momentum Cooldown:
Fans only give so many "gutsy losses" before expecting payoff or losing interest.

Legendary Loss Status:
Certain matches tagged as career-defining even if lost:
- Hardy vs Taker (ladder match)
- Omega vs Okada

Subtle Implementation (User-Locked):
- No gamey "10 gutsy loss" counter popup
- Booking team/worker tells you: "hey, this guy has lost valiantly 10 times. It's stale."
- Penalties on match ratings increase the more you ignore

Instant Classic System:
Matches rated "Instant Classic" automatically shift fan perception:
- "Hardy's gutsy fight has shifted fan perception. He's now seen as someone who could hang with top stars."

---

## ITEM #41
**DESTINATION:** BOOK-001 or Crowd Memory
**CONTENT:**
Booking Pattern Recognition (Locked):

Core Concept: "If you repeat the same show structure over and over, fans notice and engagement drops."

Example (Locked):
Tony Khan's repetitive Dynamite layouts (same format) - fans sense laziness.

Detection System:
- Track show structure across events
- Flag repetitive patterns
- Apply engagement penalty when threshold crossed

---

## ITEM #97
**DESTINATION:** Crowd System / Show Booking
**CONTENT:**
Booking Pattern Recognition System (Expanded):

Core Concept: "Tony Khan getting lazy with his Dynamite layouts with the same format over and over again. Fans can sense bullshit and patterns."

How It Works:
"If you repeat the same show structure over and over, fans notice and engagement drops."

Example:
```
You run 20 Dynamite-style shows with same layout:
- Fast opener
- Promo
- Comedy segment
- Main event

Fans slowly lose engagement without you even noticing at first.
```

---

## ITEM #98
**DESTINATION:** Popularity System / Crowd System
**CONTENT:**
Push Organicity Score (Expanded):

Core Concept: "Fans prefer pushes that feel earned (gradual buildup, major feuds won). Shoving a midcarder to main events instantly can backfire unless they crush it in matches/promos."

In Practice:
| Push Type | Fan Reaction |
|-----------|--------------|
| Gradual Rise | Organic acceptance |
| Rocket Push (delivers) | Grudging respect, potential star |
| Rocket Push (fails) | Rejection, "pushed down our throats" |

---

## ITEM #112
**DESTINATION:** Training/Development or Crowd Memory
**CONTENT:**
Breakout Performance Triggers (Locked):

Core Concept: When a match exceeds crowd expectations by a large margin, a hidden "Career Trajectory Shift" can trigger.

Effects:
- Baseline skills bump by 5-10 points over the next 6 months
- Fan perception rises
- Crowd, locker room, media perception shift
- Skills rise faster for a year or two after breakout

Example (DDP):
```
DDP: 60 baseline attributes, 80 Potential Cap
Hidden Traits: "High Coachability," "Hard Worker," "Needs Rub"

You book DDP into a semi-main with Macho.
Match overdelivers.
Post-Match Report: "Crowd buzz: 'DDP stepped up to a new level tonight.'"
Career Trajectory quietly shifts.
```

Key Insight: "Not because he just 'leveled up' RPG-style. Because he fought, struggled, got the rub, and earned a new level."

---

## ITEM #115
**DESTINATION:** Federation Identity / Booking Engine
**CONTENT:**
Cultural Gravity & Style Drift (Locked):

Core Concept: Promotions can't change style overnight. Cultural inertia resists rapid shifts.

Mechanics:
| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Style Shift Speed | Gradual = accepted, rapid = rejected |

| Worker Fit | New hires may clash with culture |

---
