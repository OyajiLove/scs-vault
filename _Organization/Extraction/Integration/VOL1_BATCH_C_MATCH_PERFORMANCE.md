```

| 60%-84% (Good) | No bonus or penalty |

Small Touches That Matter:

- Workers crawling, shaking heads, refusing to give up
- Blood dripping, sweat pouring, bodies trembling

|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| The Rock | 20 | 18 | 20 | Perfect across all |
| Steiner | 7 | 18 | 19 | Terrible fluency, incredible presence |
| Sid | 6 | 17 | 14 | Same pattern, slightly less memorable |
