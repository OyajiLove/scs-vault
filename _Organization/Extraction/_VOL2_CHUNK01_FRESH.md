### #355 - INDIE DARLING CORE TRAITS
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** MECHANIC / ARCHETYPE
**Description:** Indie Darling core traits:
- Showy
- Spot-heavy (spotfest wrestler / high spots emphasis)
- Flashy execution, even if storytelling is thin
- Selling = optional (low for many)
- Psychology = variable (many focus on moves over stories)
- High-flying common but not mandatory (could be flashy in striking, counters, reversals)
**Destination:** 01_Worker_Foundation/archetypes/indie_darling_archetype.md

**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01

### #357 - INDIE DARLING SUBTYPES (5 Total)
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** MECHANIC / ARCHETYPE
**Description:** Indie Darling subtypes:
1. **Spot Monkey** - Prioritizes exciting high-impact moves over structure. Limited selling. Crowd pops over consistency. Examples: Young Bucks (early), Jack Evans, Ricochet (pre-WWE)
2. **Flashy Technician** - Combines technical prowess with exaggerated, stylish execution. Moves look beautiful even when unnecessary. Examples: ZSJ (early indie), Will Ospreay (transitional)
3. **Cult Favourite** - Unique charisma or style earns hardcore following despite flaws. Not just moves - aura, aesthetic, underground appeal. Examples: Orange Cassidy, Nick Gage, Darby Allin
4. **Daredevil Scrapper** - Risk-taking brawler with indie ethos. Crash-and-burn fighter willing to bleed, break, or burn for reaction. Flashy through madness, not polish. Examples: Sami Callihan (early), Masada, Moxley (pre-WWE)
5. **Technical Virtuoso** - Smooth, intricate holds and counters with indie flair. Not flashy in high spots - flashy in complexity and chains. Wins hardcore purists over casual fans. Examples: Jonathan Gresham, Thatcher (early), Kyle O'Reilly (ROH peak)
**Destination:** 01_Worker_Foundation/archetypes/indie_darling_archetype.md
**Status:** LOCKED

### #358 - FLASHY TAG DEFINED
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** MECHANIC / TAG
**Description:** **Flashy** tag defined:
- Should be TAG not skill (skills are functional execution, tags are flavor/audience perception/meta)
- Meaning: Prioritizes move beauty, spectacle, and visual pop. Risk-taking even if psychology or selling suffers. Crowd loves the dazzle.
- Rationale: Flashiness is often surface-level. Can be flashy but bad at actual match logic (e.g., early Jack Evans). Some Indie Darlings evolve beyond being flashy.
- Optional future nuance: Could split into "Stylized" vs "Wildly Flashy" for deeper games
**Destination:** 03_Tags/character_tags.md

**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** MECHANIC / ARCHETYPE
**Description:** Fighting Spirit subtypes:
1. **Moeru Toukon** (燃える闘魂) - Burning Fighting Spirit. Untouchable willpower, survives through aura as much as toughness. Examples: Antonio Inoki, early Kensuke Sasaki

3. **Violent Mat Veteran** - Rugged, grizzled shooters who maul with submissions and strikes. Less theatrical, more methodical pain. Examples: Yoshiaki Fujiwara, Kazuo Yamazaki, Akira Maeda (early)
4. **Shooter Spirit** - Shootstyle-influenced competitors with violent grappling and realness. Examples: Maeda, Takada (early), Yamazaki
5. **Revolutionary Spirit** - Defiant, game-changing workhorses that shake up styles, often create booking movements by embodying rebellion. Examples: Riki Choshu, early Tatsumi Fujinami
6. **Openweight Bruiser** - Durable mid-heavy fighters who slug it out with spirit. Examples: Makabe, Honma, early Kojima
7. **Emperor of Grit** - Endurance kings, transcending brutality into performance art. Ascended version of Openweight Bruiser. Examples: Shibata, Ishii, Goto

Note: Fujinami is MUGA not Fighting Spirit. Black Charisma (Chono) is under Heel Ace. Cold Warrior, Crafty Ace, Brawling Vanguard rejected as unnecessary clutter.

## FIGHTING SPIRIT vs KING'S ROAD PHILOSOPHY

### #365 - FIGHTING SPIRIT vs KING'S ROAD: Core Differences
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** CONCEPT / DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
**Description:** Key philosophical differences between styles:

| Aspect | Fighting Spirit (NJPW) | King's Road (AJPW/NOAH) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Pace | Higher tempo, aggressive, urgent | Slower build, gradual escalation |
| Offense vs Defense | Offense-focused (attack, dominate) | Defense-focused (resist, survive, counter) |
| Match Flow | Less predictable, finishes can happen any time | Predictable structure: slow → injury tease → big escalation |
| Move Philosophy | Submissions and strikes credible throughout | Big escalation, head drops, exhaustion finishers |
| Emotion | Spirit shown in sudden survival, desperate comebacks | Spirit shown through enduring increasing punishment step-by-step |
| Injury Risk | Moderate, tied to submission damage or KO | Extremely high in final escalation stages |
| Psychology | Martial arts/military realism emphasis | Classical storytelling, mythmaking, mortality in-ring |

Summary: **Fighting Spirit = Fights. King's Road = Tragedies.**
**Destination:** 01_Worker_Foundation/match_dna.md OR design_philosophy.md

### #366 - MATCH DNA SYSTEM CONCEPT
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** CONCEPT / SYSTEM
**Description:** Workers should have Match DNA that determines:
- Expected match pacing
- Finish likelihood
- Spot choices
- Injury probabilities
- Crowd pop curves

DNA types mentioned: Fighting Spirit Match DNA, King's Road Match DNA, (future: Lucha DNA, Sports Entertainment DNA, Shoot DNA, etc.)

Workers with clashing styles (e.g., Tanahashi vs Misawa-style) would feel like two narratives smashing together.
**Destination:** 02_Booking_Core/match_dna_system.md
**Note:** HALF-BAKED but important concept

### #367 - FIGHTING SPIRIT MATCH MECHANICS
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** MECHANIC / MATCH ENGINE
**Description:** Fighting Spirit (NJPW) match mechanics:
- **Offensive Momentum System** - Fast shift momentum engine, dominant offense rewarded
- **Submission Threat Level** - Submissions have live threat throughout match, not just wear-down
- **Sudden Finish System** - Finishes can happen at any time (no guaranteed multi-kickout drama)
- **Aggression Modifier** - Bonus to strike flurries, comeback flurries
- **Spirit Bomb Tag** - Comebacks possible but dangerous (taking two DVDs in a row could kill you if spirit not triggered)
**Destination:** 02_Booking_Core/match_engine_styles.md
**Note:** Implementation guidance for match simulation

### #368 - KING'S ROAD MATCH MECHANICS
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** MECHANIC / MATCH ENGINE
**Description:** King's Road (Oudou) match mechanics:
- **Structured Escalation Engine** - Matches have phases (base → heat → escalation → killshot)
- **Accumulated Damage Tracking** - System measures limb/body core injury, must visibly wear down opponent over time
- **Injury Risk Spike** - Big head drops and insane moves massively spike injury chance
- **Crescendo Psychology** - Crowd heat builds steadily but explodes at escalation stage
- **Last Stand Spirit Tag** - Huge final gasp comebacks at 80-90% injury but few survive it twice
**Destination:** 02_Booking_Core/match_engine_styles.md

### #369 - MATCH DNA TAG DISTINCTIONS
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** MECHANIC / TAGS
**Description:** Style-specific match behavior tags:

| Head Drop Tolerance | Lower | Extremely High |
| Comeback Flurry | Short, vicious | Long, defiant |

## MATCH PRESENTATION OPTIONS

### #370 - MATCH PRESENTATION: Three Tiers
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** CONCEPT / UI
**Description:** Match presentation options (player toggle):
1. **Straight Up Result** - "Goto def. Honma via GTR (15:26)." Fast, clean, TEW-style.
2. **Result + Highlight Moments** - "Goto survived a brutal headbutt barrage and countered into a sudden GTR for the win (15:26)." Adds immersion without overkill.
3. **Condensed Storyline Recap** (Optional Toggle) - "In a hard-fought clash, Honma battered Goto with relentless headbutt assault, but Goto rallied late, catching Honma with sudden GTR to steal victory." Emotional engagement and storytelling.

Full PBP (Play-by-Play) = Way down the road, only if everything else is stable. Scope creep, QA nightmare, prone to repetition/errors.
**Destination:** 04_Match_Performance/match_presentation.md

### #371 - MATCH PRESENTATION: Why Not Full PBP
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** CONCEPT / DESIGN RATIONALE
**Description:** Reasons to avoid Full PBP at launch:
- Move Accuracy: Huge workload, even scraping databases leaves gaps
- Testing Nightmare: Logic trees, matching spots, nonsensical move order QA hell
- Player Fatigue: Most players don't want 6-10 minute simulated text match for random midcarder
- Resource Drain: AI/logic focus dragged away from world simulation into micro-match building

### #373 - KING'S ROAD CORE FLAVOR
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** MECHANIC / ARCHETYPE
**Description:** King's Road core flavor:
- Gradual escalation of violence
- Defeat is not the end - it's the foundation for future victory
- Matches are structured, emotional, mythic battles where pride, endurance, and mortality are tested
- Head drops escalated over 90s as guys started surviving more moves (natural consequence of showing guts and building on past defeats)

### #374 - KING'S ROAD SUBTYPES (Initial 7)
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Category:** MECHANIC / ARCHETYPE

1. **Orange Crush** - Idealistic, fiery young ace-in-training who absorbs brutal punishment but refuses to quit. Example: Young Kenta Kobashi (early 90s AJPW)
2. **Black Tank** (later renamed Iron Man) - Hardened, grizzled veteran warrior who outlasts violence through brute toughness and mental will. Example: Veteran Kobashi (NOAH Champion Era)
3. **Fiery Underdog** - Small but mighty, scrappy and beloved for visible struggle against bigger foes. Examples: Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, Masanobu Fuchi
4. **Sumo King** - Heavier, sumo-influenced wrestler using mass, striking, grit. Less finesse, more iron will and weight-based offense. Examples: Akira Taue, Early Genichiro Tenryu
5. **Usurper** - Cold, ruthless heir generation who threatens to overtake old guard, mixing respect and rebellion. Example: Jun Akiyama (not literally second gen, but heir generation after Four Pillars)
6. **Brash Prodigy** - Young, cocky worker full of flash and spirit but lacking emotional depth early - evolves through matches into grittier warrior. Examples: KENTA (young NOAH), early Kanemaru
7. **Hard-Luck Hero** - Beloved but often tragic figure, consistently fights valiantly but falls short until career redemption arcs. Examples: Tamon Honda, post-peak Misawa after 1999

## Half-Baked Concepts (Flag for Later)

### HB-45 - MATCH DNA SYSTEM
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Description:** Workers have "Match DNA" determining pacing, finish likelihood, spot choices, injury probabilities, crowd pop curves. DNA types: Fighting Spirit, King's Road, Lucha, Sports Entertainment, Shoot. Interesting concept but not fully specified.
**Note:** Needs formula/implementation details

### HB-46 - STYLE CLASH MECHANICS
**Source:** Vol 2, Chunk 01
**Description:** When workers with different Match DNA face each other, "two narratives smashing together." No mechanics specified for how this would work.
**Note:** Needs development
