**Application:** Big men who selectively play babyface selling mode
**Examples:** Stan Hansen, Vader (both could sell their ass off when motivated)

### #254: Weekend Warrior Tag
**Definition:** Worker not full-time professional, wrestling is hobby or temporary side gig
**Effects:**
- Rapid skill decline
- Higher chance leaving industry
- Very low drive to improve
- Increased no-show chance if injured/discouraged
- Minimal backstage political impact

**Application:** Ham and Eggers, very low-level enhancement workers in regional/territory feds

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (1 total)

### #266: Beauty in Struggle Catchline/Philosophy
**Definition:** Soul of SCS. Wrestling at its best is not about winning or losing - it's about the struggle itself.
**Emotional Core:** From Kawada to Hokuto to Misawa to Dusty to Eddie Guerrero - the struggle was more beautiful than the belt.
**Universal Connection:** Speaks to everyone who's ever tried, suffered, and refused to give up even when they knew they might fail.
**Game Philosophy:** "Does it honour beauty in struggle?" - if not, it's out.

**Usage:**
- Tagline under logo: "Squared Circle Soul: Beauty in Struggle"
- Manual intro
- Tone for design decisions
- Booking philosophy

**Key Insight:** Long title reigns are less beautiful than the chases. Heroism is forged in scars, not smiles.

## PROMO GENERATION EXAMPLE

### #245: Eric Embry on Dusty Rhodes (after attempted hit-and-run)

**Tone:** Raspy, emotional, trembling, slightly off-balance
**Themes:** Personal betrayal, class anger ("how many hungry boys you stepped on"), vicious imagery

**Key Line:**
> "You gonna ride straight into me, screaming and begging, while the American Dream turns into the American Nightmare — and it ends...in a ditch."

**Technical Notes:**
- Didn't "out-act" Embry
- Personal stakes over generic insults
- Realistic working-class diction
- Controlled build (mocking → rage → cold)
