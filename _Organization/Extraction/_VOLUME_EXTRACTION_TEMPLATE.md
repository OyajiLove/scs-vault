## 🎯 THIS SESSION'S TARGETS

**Primary Systems (pick 3-5 max):**
1. [System] - [what to look for]
2. [System] - [what to look for]
3. [System] - [what to look for]

**Secondary (if time permits):**
4. [System]
5. [System]

**Extraction Types (check what applies):**
- [ ] Locked mechanics (numbers, formulas, thresholds)
- [ ] Design rationale (the WHY behind decisions)
- [ ] Concrete examples (specific scenarios illustrating mechanics)
- [ ] Half-baked ideas (parking lot candidates)
- [ ] Edge cases (weird scenarios discussed)
- [ ] Contradictions (conflicts with locked systems)

---

## 🔍 STEP 1: PATTERN SCAN

Before deep reading, search the volume for these patterns:

**Lock markers:** "locked", "final", "confirmed", "✅", "going with", "decided"
**Numbers:** percentages, multipliers, "×", "/", "per", "every", "after X", "1-20", "0-100"
**Formulas:** "=", "calculated", "formula", "equation"
**Design rationale:** "because", "reason", "why", "the goal", "this ensures", "we want"
**Examples:** wrestler names (Flair, Austin, Misawa, etc.), "for example", "e.g.", "like when"
**Questions:** "?", "should we", "what about", "TBD", "TODO", "need to figure out"

**System-specific terms:** [Add relevant keywords for target systems]

**Report:** How many hits per pattern? Which sections look dense with content?

---

## 🔬 STEP 2: TARGETED EXTRACTION

For each finding, use this format:

```
[EMOJI] [Brief Title]
System: [Which system]
Type: [Locked/Rationale/Example/Formula/Edge Case/Contradiction]
Index Status: [Already in index? Y/N]
Content: [Exact quote or paraphrase with context]
Action: [Add to index / Update bible entry X / Flag for review / Parking lot]
```

**Emoji Key:**
- 🔢 = Numbers/Formulas
- 💡 = Design Rationale
- 📊 = Concrete Example
- ⚠️ = Contradiction
- 🅿️ = Parking Lot candidate
- ✅ = Confirms existing mechanic
- ❓ = Answers open question

---

## ⛔ STOP CONDITIONS

- If you've extracted **15+ items**, PAUSE and report before continuing
- If a section runs **longer than expected**, summarize and ask if I want deep dive
- If you find something that **contradicts locked systems**, FLAG IMMEDIATELY
- If you're **unsure whether something is already captured**, check the index first

---

## 📊 END WITH

1. **Findings Summary Table** - organized by system
2. **Index Updates Needed** - what to add to _MASTER_MECHANICS_INDEX.md
3. **Bible Updates Needed** - which existing entries need additions
4. **Sections Skipped** - what needs deeper review in a follow-up session
5. **Open Questions Resolved** - any ❓ items from the index that got answered
6. **New Open Questions** - anything flagged for future resolution

---

## 🧠 GUIDELINES

- **Check the index FIRST** before flagging something as "missed"
- Early volumes have early versions: note evolution, don't assume contradiction
- Design rationale is GOLD: capture the WHY, not just the WHAT
- Concrete examples with real wrestler names are excellent for bible entries
- If something is already in the index as 🔒, only note if you find NEW detail
- Don't re-extract what we already have, that's wasted effort

---

## 📁 FILES YOU'LL NEED

1. **Vol [X] PDF/TXT** - the source material
2. **_MASTER_MECHANICS_INDEX.md** - your cross-reference
3. **Relevant bible entries** - for the target systems

---

## 🚀 START

Begin with the pattern scan. Report hit counts and promising sections before diving into extraction.

If the volume is massive, propose breaking it into chunks (e.g., pages 1-50, 51-100, etc.) and we'll tackle them sequentially.

Let's find what we missed. 🔍

# SCS VOLUME 1 - SURGICAL EXTRACTION

## 📋 CONTEXT

We're extracting missed content from **Volume 1** using a TARGETED approach.

**Volume 1 Focus:** Foundation systems, worker archetypes, initial booking concepts
**Key Systems:** Worker Skills, Hidden Personality, Match Engine origins, early Booking concepts

**Your Reference Tool:** `_MASTER_MECHANICS_INDEX.md` in the System Bible
- 🔒 = Already captured, verify only
- 📝 = Conceptual, needs mechanics
- ❓ = Open question, prioritize finding answers

---

## 🎯 THIS SESSION'S TARGETS

**Primary Systems (Vol 1 originated these):**
1. Worker Skills - check for missed formulas, rating examples, stat interactions
2. Hidden Personality - early trait concepts before Vol 3-4 expansion
3. Match Engine - Fire Pro vision, original design rationale

**Secondary (if time permits):**
4. Early Booking concepts - anything that became Booking Engine
5. Popularity foundations - before the 0-100 scale was locked

**Extraction Types:**
- [x] Locked mechanics (numbers, formulas, thresholds)
- [x] Design rationale (the WHY behind decisions)
- [x] Concrete examples (specific scenarios illustrating mechanics)
- [ ] Half-baked ideas (parking lot candidates) - note but don't prioritize
- [ ] Contradictions - flag immediately if found
