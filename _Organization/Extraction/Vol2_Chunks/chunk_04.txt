📚 New Booking Behavior Tags
Tag Name Description
Talent Hoarder Signs and stockpiles workers not necessarily to push them — just to keep them from going elsewhere.
Booking Martyr Will sacrifice own push or brand position to get others over (rare, but important).
Political Assassin Uses internal politics ruthlessly to destroy rivals, kill pushes, sabotage feuds.
Booking Narcissist Builds every show around themselves or their chosen inner circle — ignores organic crowd reactions.

Focused Core Booker Believes in using a smaller, tightly knit main event scene rather than stockpiling huge rosters. Prefers building depth and long arcs with limited top talent.
Expansionist Visionary Aggressively seeks to expand beyond traditional territorial boundaries or regional limits. Will attempt national or global growth even at the cost of tradition or stability.

Territory Raider Booker actively raids talent from smaller promotions without regard for local stability.
