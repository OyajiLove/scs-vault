# VOL 2 CHUNK 06 (Lines 446-534)
# EXTRACTION PRIORITY: Scandal Shielding System, Management Tags, Redemption Paths

## KEY SYSTEMS TO EXTRACT:

### "tovarisch" Origin
- User requests this term of endearment instead of "partner" or "boss"
- Origin: Tzvi used to call them this, it was endearing

### Scandal Shielding System (FULL - HIGH PRIORITY)

Core Concepts:
| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Shield Strength | How good a company/star is at covering up scandals |
| Cover-Up Tactics | Bribes, media suppression, legal settlements, quiet firings |
| Fan Suspension of Disbelief | How long fans "hold out" before turning |
| Time Bomb Effect | Scandals leak slowly, shield delays collapse doesn't erase risk |
| Public Outrage Timer | Each scandal ticks, can fade or erupt depending on era/media |

Shield Factors:
| Factor | Shield Bonus |
|--------|--------------|
| Promotion Size | Small → Medium → Massive boost |
| Star Power | Midcarder: None. Main Eventer: Big |
| Fan Loyalty | Stronger fans = stronger early shielding |
| Era Sensitivity | 80s-early 90s: +shielding. 00s-2020s: -shielding |
| Corporate Ownership | Better PR suppression tools |
| Management Philosophy | Dirty loyalty = shield harder. Clean hands = cut dead weight faster |

**Formula:**
Shield Strength = (Promotion Size Mod) + (Star Power Mod) + (Fan Loyalty Mod) + (Management Corruption Mod) – (Era Outrage Mod) – (Scandal Severity Mod)

Shield Strength = weeks/months/years scandal can be hidden before backlash

**Shield Rules:**
| Situation | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Shield breaks naturally | Massive sudden backlash explosion, worse than if owned early |
| Shield holds successfully | Scandal fades, roll chance to "burn off" after X months |
| Multiple scandals stack | Shield weakens dramatically |
| Loyalty drops over time | Fan loyalty erosion weakens future shields |
| Whistleblower Events | Random: shield forcefully broken by leaks/exposes |

**Shield Decay Rules:**
| Time Passing | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| 1-3 Months | Shield drops -5% to -10% naturally unless PR actions taken |
| Major New Scandal | Shield instantly drops -25%+ and may fully collapse |
| Redemption Arcs | Good PR actions can rebuild shield partially |

### Management Tags (NEW - HIGH PRIORITY)
| Tag Name | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Dirty Loyalty | Shields scandals, protects friends, promotes silence |
| Clean Hands Philosophy | Fires scandals fast, promotes merit and ethics |
| Expansionist Visionary | Obsessed with growth, risks scandals for exposure |
| Talent Hoarder | Signs too many workers to deny competitors |
| Homegrown Purist | Creates stars internally rather than stealing |
| Corporate Overlord | Prioritizes PR image and sponsor relationships |
| Outlaw Spirit | Welcomes chaos and edginess as branding (ECW) |
| Whistleblower Friendly | Encourages internal reporting, protects whistleblowers |
| Dirty Cover-Up Artist | Uses resources for suppressing lawsuits, hush money |
| Booker's Playground | Treats booking as personal fantasy, ignores fans |
| Worker First Culture | Prioritizes health, stability, creative satisfaction |

### Redemption Paths System (HIGH PRIORITY)

Core Mechanics:
| Mechanic | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Redemption Opportunity Roll | Based on humility, charisma, loyalty depth |
| Management Decisions | Allow redemption run or blacklist forever |
| Fanbase Sensitivity | Some forgive easier, others harsh |
| Redemption Actions | Apology, rehab, charity, humility arcs |
| Success/Failure | Depends on sincerity, follow-through, time, severity |

Redemption Actions:
| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Public Apology | Minor pop recovery if sincere; blowback if fake |
| Real-Life Charity/Activism | Boosts public image slowly |
| In-Character Humility Arcs | Loses matches, pays dues (storyline penance) |
| Authentic Career Reinvention | New persona, humble interviews |
| Full Retirement for Reflection | Time away softens fans |
| Rehabilitation Programs | Restores credibility if drug/alcohol scandal |

Key Factors:
- Scandal Severity: Some truly career-killing, no redemption possible
- Fanbase Type: Progressive/younger more demanding of proof
- Management Behavior: Dirty Loyalty fakes redemption; Clean Hands demands real change
- Time: Real redemption requires years, not months
