# EXTRACTION PRIORITY: Fan Loyalty Resistance System, Career Arcs Framework, Scandal System Introduction

## KEY SYSTEMS TO EXTRACT:

### Career Arcs Framework (HIGH PRIORITY)
Stages of wrestler life cycle:
| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Rookie Years | Low pop, basic traits (underdog, green, reckless, hungry) |
| Breakout | Jump via miracle match, angle, or political openings |
| Fame | Success pressures behavior, some humble, some monsters |
| Physical Decline | Injuries, aging, loss of passion |
| Crisis | Scandals, betrayals, being leapfrogged |
| Reinvention | Adapt new personas or cling to old success |
| Retirement Attempts | Some leave, some unretire ("One More Match") |
| Legacy | Legends, bitter obscurity, or indie reinvention |

Traits can evolve: Consummate Professional → Booking Narcissist if ego blooms
Event triggers needed for: injury, scandal, betrayal, stage shifts

### Fan Loyalty Resistance System (HIGH PRIORITY)
Formula: Fan Resistance % = (Base Loyalty) + (Star Power Modifier) + (Promotion Size Modifier) – (Scandal Severity Modifier) – (Era Outrage Modifier)

Fanbase Types & Scandal Tolerance:
| Fanbase Type | Loyalty | Scandal Tolerance | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Hardcore Company Loyalists | Extremely high | High | Classic company zombies, lifers |
| Indie Hardcore Fans | Medium | Very low | Turn on hypocrites fast |
| Family-Friendly Fans | Medium-high | Very low | Children/drugs/abuse = instant kill |
| Deathmatch Outlaw Fans | Low | Medium-high | Care about authenticity |
| Lucha Traditionalists | High | Medium | Protect local icons longer |
| Joshi Superfans | High | Low | Purity matters, betrayals devastating |
| Edgy Attitude Era Types | Medium | Medium-high | Love antiheroes, tolerate bad behavior |

### Scandal Shielding System (Intro - continued in Chunk 06-07)
- Big stars and promotions survive scandals easier
- Institutional loyalty/sickness mechanic
- Era sensitivity: 70s-90s absorb easier than 00s+
- Smaller promotions = catastrophic collapse faster
- Fans are willing to ignore terrible deeds due to loyalty
- Power brokers know and hide scandals internally

Key Features:
- Scandal Shielding: Cover up chances for major stars/promotions
- Fanbase Loyalty Buffers: Backlash delayed/softened by loyalty
- Era Sensitivity: Earlier eras absorb scandal easier
- Promotion Size Risk: Indies collapse faster after exposure
- Redemption Bias: High loyalty enables "From the Ashes" comebacks
- Institutional Rot: Corruption bleeds into morale, perception, media relationships

### Database Compilation Discussion
- 440+ traits compiled but export issues
- Three-column structure: Trait Name | Description | Category
- Categories: Physical, In-Ring, Personality/Backstage, Career Trajectory, Promo/Media, Scandal, Booking/Promoter, Fan Perception, Special Skills, Deathmatch, Era-Specific

## RAW CONTENT (Key Excerpts):

CAREER ARCS - How Workers' Lives Should Flow:
Stage Description
Rookie Years Low pop, basic traits dominate (underdog, green, reckless, hungry)
Breakout Either through miracle match, angle, or political openings — jump up cards
Fame Success pressures behavior — some stay humble, some become monsters
Physical Decline Injuries, aging, loss of passion start creeping
Crisis Scandals, locker room betrayals, being leapfrogged by new stars
Reinvention Some adapt new personas; others cling desperately to old success
Retirement Attempts Some truly leave, some unretire multiple times ("One More Match")
Legacy Some become legends, others fade into bitter obscurity or reinvent indie careers

Already in design (loose):
- Traits can evolve (e.g., Consummate Professional → Booking Narcissist if ego blooms)
- Injury, scandal, betrayal events trigger evolution
- Heat, merch, fan support modulate dynamically over time

Needed:
- Clean event triggers (e.g., severe scandal triggers drop in pop/fan support unless protected)
- Career arc randomizers (chance-based injury, political betrayals, push sabotage)

Fan Loyalty Resistance Formula:
Fan Resistance % = (Base Loyalty) + (Star Power Modifier) + (Promotion Size Modifier) – (Scandal Severity Modifier) – (Era Outrage Modifier)

This % determines:
- How fast backlash happens
- How severe the pop/merch/sponsor drop is
- Whether the scandal "sticks" permanently

Example 1: Top Star in 1986 NWA (Mid-Size)
Fan Type: Hardcore Territorial Loyalists
Scandal: Cheating, bar fight, DUI
Base Loyalty: 75% + Star Power: +10% + Promo Size: +5% - Scandal Severity: -10% - Era Outrage: -5%
Result: 75% resistance = Minor damage, survives

Example 2: Rising Indie Star in 2024 (Small)
Fan Type: Indie Hardcore
Scandal: Racist comments leak
Base Loyalty: 30% + Star Power: +5% + Promo Size: +0% - Scandal Severity: -25% - Era Outrage: -20%
Result: -10% resistance = Immediate collapse, fired
