# EXTRACTION PRIORITY: Hidden Tags System, Timed Trait Reveal, Global Event Stream, Weather Risk System

## KEY SYSTEMS TO EXTRACT:

### Hidden Tags System (MAJOR - HIGH PRIORITY)

**Core Concept:**
Certain tags (especially scandalous, moral, dark sides) are hidden at start. Only revealed if triggered by in-game events.
- In-ring skills: Visible
- Work ethic: Visible
- "Is secretly a racist abuser": Hidden until exposed

**Tags That Should Be Hidden Until Exposed:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Scandalous Personality | Racist, Sexist, Homophobic, Transphobic, Predator, Blackmailer, Abusive Trainer, Seedy, If He Dies He Dies |
| Political/Corporate | Dirty Loyalty, Cover-Up Artist, Corruption Sympathizer |
| Mental/Emotional Instability | Dangerously Intoxicated, Self-Destructive, Narcissistic, Bunker Mentality |
| Locker Room Time Bombs | Snake in the Grass, Self-Preserver, Powder Keg Temper |
| Long-Term Decline Risks | Career Implosion Risks, Substance Abuse Downslide |

**How Hidden Tags Get Revealed:**
| Trigger | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Scandal Event | Tag revealed publicly (e.g., "Star X exposed as abuser") |
| Shoot Interview | Ex-colleague airs grievances, hidden tags surface |
| Locker Room Leaks | Whispers lead to media, traits partially exposed |
| Social Media Blow-Up | Wrestler posts something awful, reveals bigotry |
| Investigative Journalism | Reporter uncovers abuse cover-ups, mass exposures |
| Court Cases | Legal records become public, full exposure |

**System Mechanics:**
- Tags have Visibility Flag (Public/Hidden)
- Events check visibility triggers
- Exposure effects: Loyalty loss, sponsor loss, fan mutation, worker reactions
- Workers might hide additional toxic traits unless repeated scandals expose more

### Timed Trait Reveal System (HIGH PRIORITY)

**How It Works:**
| Feature | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Activation Date | Each hidden tag has a date it becomes public |
| Historical Saves | Only know what was public at the time |
| Activation Event | Triggers exposure during play, or auto-marked if starting post-scandal |
| Hidden Forever | Some skeletons never surface unless triggered |
| Timed Reactions | Sponsor/fan reactions happen only once exposure happens |

**Example Timeline - Hulk Hogan:**
| Year | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1987 | Racist (Hidden) | "Normal" casual racism tolerated at the time |
| 2005 | Aging Star | Beloved by casuals, progressive fans skeptical |
| 2015 | Tape Leaks | Racist Tag + Deep Racism revealed publicly |
| 2016 | Fallout Year | Sponsors sever, WWE cuts ties, fanbase fractures |
| 2020 | Partial Rehabilitation | Fans split between forgiveness and disgust |

**Example Timeline - Chris Benoit:**
| Year | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1995 | Beloved Workhorse | No negative traits public |
| 2000 | High Level Career | Minor CTE signs hidden, no public red flags |
| 2006 | Deepening Instability (Hidden) | Quiet backstage concerns, unseen to players |
| 2007 | Murder-Suicide Event | Hidden tags explode into public view |
| Post-2007 | Blacklisted | Promotion of matches removed |

### Global Event Stream (HIGH PRIORITY)

Major events that affect wrestling world:
| Event | Effects |
|-------|---------|
| 9/11 (2001) | Nationalism surge, rah-rah US gimmicks cheered, anti-American heels forced to mask, blood toned down, scandal backlash multiplied |
| 2008 Recession | Promotions struggle unless offering hope stories, ticket prices critical, indie deaths, pay demands drop |
| COVID-19 (2020) | Live event shutdowns, empty arena shows, streaming dominance, small promotions with TV survive, hardcore loyalty hardens |
| Internet Explosion (Late 90s-2000s) | Smart marks rise, kayfabe drops, scandal coverage explodes, indie buzz viable, instant backlash risk |

**How Global Events Affect Game:**
| Layer | Interaction |
|-------|-------------|
| Fanbase DNA Shifts | Patriotism, violence tolerance, scandal sensitivity, spending habits |
| Worker Behaviour | Relocation, anxiety, risk-taking, political expressions |
| Promotion Management | Booking style, roster changes, budget, market targeting |
| Scandal Fallout Modifiers | Forgiveness/outrage multipliers based on cultural mood |
| Touring Viability | Regions become unstable, inaccessible, or hyper-profitable |

### Weather Risk System (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Core Concept:**
- Every Region has base climate/weather patterns and extreme weather risks
- Every Outdoor Show rolls weather conditions before event
- Every Venue has weather protection level and resilience rating
- Every Worker has Adaptability to Conditions tag

**Weather Impacts:**
| Condition | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Rain (Light/Moderate/Heavy) | Ring slippery, flyers at higher risk, brawlers thrive |
| Wind (Mild/Strong/Dangerous) | Throws off dives, top rope spots, affects staging |
| Cold Snap | Worker cardio/endurance affected, crowd patience, injury risk |
| Heatwave | Worker fatigue spikes, crowd enthusiasm drops, health risks |
| Snow | Attendance drops, transport issues, cancellations |
| Thunderstorms | High chance of cancellation, evacuations, extreme injuries |

**Regional Climate:**
| Region | Weather Risks |
|--------|---------------|
| Tokyo | Humid summers, typhoons July-September, rainstorms |
| Osaka | Hotter inland, sweltering heat outdoor risk |
| Northern Japan | Heavy snow winters, hardcore snow shows possible |
| Texas | Heatwaves, flash thunderstorms, occasional tornadoes |
| Florida | Summer rain, hurricanes August-October |
| California | Very dry, minimal rain, freak storms rare |
| Mexico City | Rainy season May-October, afternoon rains |
| Toronto | Cold winters, summer rain, December snow possible |
| UK | Light rain often, heavy rain sporadic |

**Worker Adaptability Tags:**
| Tag | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| Rain Master | Thrives in rain, solid footing (Okada, MiSu, AJW women) |
| Sun Warrior | Best in clear hot outdoor (lucha heroes, beach festivals) |
| Ice Cold Professional | Works well in cold, snowstorms |
| Weather Fragile | Falls apart when conditions not perfect |
| Show Must Go On | Wrestles no matter what, gains fan loyalty |

## RAW CONTENT (Key Example):

Suzuki 30th Anniversary Show (Rainstorm):
- Heavy Rain: Ring dangerously slick
- MiSu + Okada Adaptability: Fight on, modify pacing, embrace rain as epic drama
- Crowd: 1,000 diehards in ponchos, emotionally locked in, loyalty boost
- Result: Legendary atmosphere, minor injuries risked, major historical moment

"Legendary moments come from those who wrestle through storms without blinking."
