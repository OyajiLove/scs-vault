# EXTRACTION PRIORITY: Scandal Fallout Completion, Fanbase DNA Attributes, Research Sources

## KEY SYSTEMS TO EXTRACT:

### Scandal Fallout System - Damage Severity by Response (COMPLETION)

**Fallout Flowchart Example:** Midcard Worker Exposed for Racist Behavior (Modern Era)
1. Fans Notice: Progressive fans boycott, casuals split
2. Sponsors Notice: Brands quietly pull merch and tie-ins
3. Locker Room Reaction: Talent requests releases, leaks to podcasts
4. Media Cycle Revives: Promotion dragged when promoting shows
5. Cumulative Reputation Damage: Easier poaching, harder TV renegotiation

**Damage Severity by Response:**
| Management Action | Outcome |
|-------------------|---------|
| Immediate Termination | Some backlash, but protects long-term health |
| Public Apology + Internal Suspension | Fans split, sponsors still wary |
| Denial, Retain Worker | Risk of full fan revolt, sponsor walkouts, locker room mutinies |
| Quiet Phasing Out | Backlash softens somewhat, but damage control messy and slow |

**Special Scenarios:**
| Situation | Fallout |
|-----------|---------|
| Home Region Loyalty | Toxic figures beloved locally can cause regional backlash on firing |
| Locker Room Star Power Dynamics | Politically powerful toxic figures can crush whistleblowers, worsens rot |
| Corporate Pressure | Networks and sponsors often force action, not fans |

### Fanbase/Region DNA Attributes (INTRO - HIGH PRIORITY)
| Attribute | What It Tracks |
|-----------|----------------|
| Age Skew | Younger vs older fans |
| Political Lean | Conservative, liberal, libertarian, socialist, apolitical |
| Gender Balance | Male-heavy, female-heavy, balanced |

| Historical Loyalty Depth | Tribalistic or flaky |

Regional Templates to Build:
- U.S. (by regions)
- Japan
- Mexico
- Canada
- UK
- Europe (clustered styles)

Mechanics to Develop:
- Fanbase evolution over decades
- Link promotions dynamically to fanbase types
- "Fanbase Drift" mechanic (demographics shift based on booking/branding)

### Research Sources Discussion (Reference)
Historical archive building for SCS:
- Wrestling Observer (primary, paid)
- PW Torch newsletters through 2022 (full archive acquired)
- DVDVR Archives (chemistry, workrate arcs)
- PWI 500 Year-by-Year (fan perception tracking)
- Weekly Pro/Glow/Championship Wrestling (cultural time-capsule)

Modern Sources (2022+):
| Source | Strengths |
|--------|-----------|
| Voices of Wrestling | Strong Japanese/indie analysis, year-end reviews |
| Fightful | Insider scoops, contracts, backstage heat |
| Post Wrestling | Calm professional coverage, business trends |
| Cagematch.net | Fan consensus, career trajectory ratings |
| Reddit r/SquaredCircle | Crowdsourced scandal threads, event fallout |
| The Ringer | Culturally serious mainstream coverage |

**PW Torch vs Observer:**
| Factor | Observer | Torch |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Overall Bias | Skeptical of management | More ethical outrage, worker-friendly |
| Scandal Sensitivity | High when affecting business | Very high for wrestler health/dignity |
| Match Analysis | Star ratings + story | Psychology and historical place |
| Worker Politics | Generally neutral | More progressive/worker-first |

## RAW CONTENT (Key Excerpts):

Fallout from retaining scandalized/toxic worker causes slow but deadly rot across:
- Fans
- Sponsors
- Media
- Locker room
- Talent pipeline
- Brand reputation

The bigger the worker's star power, the longer you might survive — but the higher the final cost if you miscalculate. Management "winning" in the short term often creates death by a thousand cuts.

Full Torch access = No "Observer blindness." No missing indie arcs. No one-sided scandal narratives. Complete soul of wrestling history from 80s to present.
