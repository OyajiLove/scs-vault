# VOL 2 CHUNK 10 (Lines 802-887)
# EXTRACTION PRIORITY: Booking Engine Phase 1 Core, Promotion Philosophy Settings, Predictability & Stakes System

## KEY SYSTEMS TO EXTRACT:

### Booking Engine Phase 1 - Core Match Inputs (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Core Inputs for Each Match:**
| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Participants | Wrestlers, tag teams, managers, seconds, special refs |
| Match Type | Singles, tag, ladder, cage, etc. (from match type database) |
| Placement on Card | Opener, cool-down, semi-main, main, post-main |
| Stakes | Title, grudge, tournament, contract, loser leaves, retirement, or none |
| Intended Outcome | Who wins, how (pin, submission, countout, DQ), finish style |
| Booking Intent | Why booked: elevate, cool down, extend feud, payoff, test chemistry |
| Agenting / Flow Control | Pacing, layout, structure (player or semi-automated) |

### Promotion Booking Philosophy Settings (HIGH PRIORITY)
| Setting | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Match Importance Focus | Match quality, storyline continuation, or crowd energy |
| Push Strategy | Parity (50/50), rocket push, slow burn, veteran protection, heat magnets |
| Fan Type Targeting | Smart mark, casual, kids/family, nostalgia, violent/hardcore, comedy |
| Booking Tone | Serious gritty realism, chaotic crash TV, meta-comedy, emotional legacy |
| House Style Enforcement | How rigidly matches conform to in-universe style (All Japan, Lucha, NJPW) |

Note: Context matters for finish interpretation
- A dusty finish in WCW 1997? Sure.
- Same in NOAH 2005? Nuclear backlash.

### Post-Match Evaluation Layers
| Layer | Evaluation |
|-------|------------|
| Chemistry | Prior matches, natural synergy, real-life beef, stylistic compatibility |
| Card Placement Fit | Over-deliver in weak spot or under-deliver in hot one? |
| Match Type Fit | Do workers belong in this gimmick? (Comedy guy in blood feud = penalty) |
| Fan Reaction | Real heat, split chants, dead silence, derision |
| Finish Quality | Predictable, exciting, emotional, abrupt, dusty, flat, cathartic, enraging |
| Narrative Movement | Did match move story? Surprise fans? Pay off? Kill heat? Spark new? |

### Outcome Effects Per Match
| Effect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Match Rating | Fan response, critic rating, promotion prestige |
| Worker Momentum | Short-term trajectory boost/drop |
| Popularity Adjustment | Long-term fan connection shift |
| Backstage Morale | Workers happy with finish/positioning or resentful |
| Booking Memory Retention | Will crowd remember this? (Crowd Memory System) |
| Scandal Risk Triggers | Violent, tasteless, dangerous bookings = potential backlash |

### Segment Engine (Non-Match Booking)
| Segment Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| Promo | Live or pre-taped, in-ring or backstage |
| Post-Match Angle | Beatdowns, betrayals, reconciliations, stare-downs |
| Contract Signings / Brawls | Build big-match energy |
| Returns / Debuts / Retirements | Surprise pops, emotional storytelling |
| Fan Interactions / PR Events | Meet-and-greets, scandals, media comments |
| Backstage Fights / Gossip | Seeds morale, scandal risk, political intrigue |

All segments run on same logic as matches: placement, crowd energy, memory tracking, fallout, scandal risk

### Predictability Pressure & Stakes Logic (MAJOR - HIGH PRIORITY)

**Match Predictability Index:**
| Description | Function |
|-------------|----------|
| System gauges outcome obviousness | Based on popularity, momentum, booking history, win streaks, feud direction, title placement |
| High predictability = less buzz | Unless storytelling or performance flips expectation |
| Low predictability = buzz spike | Adds emotional tension, fan engagement, speculation |

**Stakes Weight Tracker:**
| Stakes Type | Examples |
|-------------|----------|
| Title Match | Heavyweight belt, tag belts = high stakes default |
| Career Impact | "Must win to earn shot," "Loser leaves town," proving match |
| Reputation Stakes | Newcomer vs legend (Kikuchi vs Hansen), mentor vs student |
| Moral Stakes | Feud blowoff, revenge, redemption, betrayal payoff |
| Booking Risk | Both guys can't afford to lose = booking into a corner |
| Announcer Highlight Multiplier | Commentary impacts crowd buy-in |

**Booking Into a Corner Penalty System:**
| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Both workers on win streaks or need rehab | High-risk match flagged |
| Flat/cheap finish | Crowd backlash, feud derailment, fan trust erosion |
| Protected loss earned emotionally | Fanbase may accept (noble effort framing) |

"A loss can elevate — if you protect the soul of the performer."

**Underdog Story Incentives:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Crowd engagement in predictable match | If layout, emotion, and announcers frame correctly |
| Boosts Feud Memory even in loss | If match is brutal, emotional, heroic |
| Outcome less important than effort | Boosts buzz, credibility, future heat |

"This is how you elevate without wins. This is how you build a crowd's hope."

**System Locked:**
- Predictability Index: How obvious is finish?
- Stakes Weight: What actually matters?
- Booking Corner Penalty: Did booker screw themselves?
- Underdog Reward System: Losses that feel like wins
- Announcer Boost: Commentary matters, saves, sells

## RAW CONTENT (Key Quotes):

"Matches aren't just card filler. They're stories, statements, sparks, and sometimes scandals."

"This isn't just 'who wins?' It's 'why should I care who wins — and what happens if I'm right?'"

"Turn too often? Crowd dies. Turn perfectly? They carry it for life."
