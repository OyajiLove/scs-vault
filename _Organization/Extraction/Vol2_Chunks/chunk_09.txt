# VOL 2 CHUNK 09 (Lines 713-801)
# EXTRACTION PRIORITY: Weather Risk Refinements, Tampa Climate Profile, Booking Engine Momentum/Popularity

## KEY SYSTEMS TO EXTRACT:

### Weather Risk System - Refinements (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Mental Attribute: Adaptability**
- No separate weather tags needed
- Use existing Mental Attribute: Adaptability to Environment and Circumstance
- Higher Adaptability = better performance in rough weather
- Lower Adaptability = struggles with footing, cardio, match psychology

**Show Type Modifiers:**
| Event Type | Risk Modifier |
|------------|---------------|
| Outdoor, No Protection | Full weather impact (rain, lightning, wind, heat) |
| Outdoor, Partial Protection | Reduced rain impact, but wind/heat still dangerous |
| Indoor | Weather limited to crowd travel issues, power outages, worker fatigue |

**Hurricane Season Reality:**
- Outdoor shows: High risk of cancellation
- Indoor arena shows: Continue normally unless direct hit/airport closures/evacuation
- Lighter attendance common due to travel fears, hardcore locals still turn out

**Climate Change Modernization:**
- Flash floods added to urban outdoor bookings (low probability, even outside monsoon)
- Summers hotter/deadlier across major cities, severe heat modifiers from mid-90s onward
- Dangerous humid heatwaves in previously milder cities (Vancouver, London)
- Worker health consequences spike harder (heat exhaustion, dehydration, cardiac events)

**Tokyo Climate Change Example:**
| Era | Summer Condition | Notes |
|-----|------------------|-------|
| 1980s-90s | Hot and humid (29-32°C) | Manageable but energy-draining |
| 2020s | Brutally hot (33-37°C peaks) | Dangerous outdoor conditions, heat stroke deaths common |
| New Risks | Flash flooding from intense typhoons | City can shut down transport, fans stranded |

**Severe Weather Effects:**
| Factor | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Major Snowstorm | Airports close, wrestlers trapped/rerouted, card changes needed |
| Thunderstorm/Hurricane | Show potentially canceled, insurance payouts may mitigate |
| Heavy Rain (Outdoor) | Attendance drops, ring slippery, injury risk, card may shorten |
| Extreme Heat | Fatigue/dehydration risks spike, crowd energy drains |
| Windstorms | Danger to scaffolding, lighting, high-flying spots = botch risks |

**Missing Workers: Travel Blockades:**
| Situation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Key workers stranded (snowstorm/typhoon) | Emergency card reshuffling, disappointing replacements |
| Foreign talent stuck abroad (visa/political) | Entire tour collapses if critical mass lost |
| Hardcore fans travel in dangerous weather | Loyalty boost, higher merch per head |
| Casual fans stay home | Gate disaster, revenue shortfall, PR disaster if show promoted unsafely |

### Tampa, Florida - Climate Profile (SAMPLE)

**General Climate:**
| Factor | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Primary Climate | Humid Subtropical |
| Temperature Range | 18°C (Jan) → 32°C (July) |
| Humidity | High year-round, brutal May-September |
| Rainfall | Heavy summer, lighter winters |
| Storm Season | Hurricane threats August-October |
| Random Severe | Thunderstorms common, lightning capital of North America |

**Seasonal Risk Table:**
| Season | Conditions | Risk |
|--------|------------|------|
| Winter (Dec-Feb) | Mild, dry, 20°C average | Excellent for outdoor shows |
| Spring (Mar-May) | Warming, sporadic thunderstorms | Mostly good, early May outdoor risk |
| Summer (Jun-Aug) | Brutal heat, daily afternoon thunderstorms | Dangerous for outdoor, indoor preferred |
| Fall (Sep-Nov) | Peak hurricane danger | Outdoor risky without contingency |

**Special Notes:**
- Championship Wrestling from Florida roots = smart, loyal old-school fans
- Hardcore undercurrent survives into indie shows
- Crowds forgiving of rough outdoor shows if handled with heart
- Surviving weather-wrecked show = folk hero status

### Loose Lips Tag Categorization
- Category: Personality/Backstage Behaviour
- Subcategory: Locker Room Dynamics / Info Management
- Not political, not media trait, reflects personal tendency to overshare
- Affects locker room stability, booking secrecy, scandal surfacing

### Booking Engine Phase 2 - Momentum & Popularity (INTRO)

**Momentum (Short-Term Heat):**
| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Momentum Rating (0-100) | Worker's current buzz/trajectory |
| Decay Rate | Based on house style, attention span, media saturation |
| Momentum Shock Events | Betrayals, returns, shoots create huge spikes |
| Momentum Stall | Sitting off TV too long collapses momentum |

Influenced by: Match performance, match type/placement, booking intent vs reaction, finishes, post-match segments, media mentions, crowd noise, emotional storytelling

Momentum can spike: Hot promo, bloody loss, heroic effort, betrayal, viral moment
Momentum can die: 50/50 booking, dead crowd, overexposure, no direction

**Popularity (Long-Term Legacy):**
| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Global Popularity Rating | Composite based on historical fan reaction |
| Regional Popularity Spread | Gods in Tokyo but ignored in Houston |
| Sustained Legacy | Legends retain popularity post-retirement |
| False Popularity | Push saturation but cold fans = manufactured star tag |

Tied to: Match ratings over time, big wins/losses, feud memories, crowd reactions, merch sales, championship reigns, legendary segments

## RAW CONTENT (Key Quote):

"Wrestling isn't just fought in the ring. It's fought in airports, in rainstorms, in the air itself."

"Momentum is heat — and you can't hold heat in your hands."

"Popularity is memory. It's not the pop you got tonight — it's how people remember you next year."
