## KEY DESIGN DECISIONS

### Fighting Spirit vs King's Road Match Mechanics

**Fighting Spirit (NJPW):**
- Offensive momentum system (fast shifts)
- Submissions credible throughout
- Sudden finish system (no guaranteed kickouts)
- Aggression modifier
- Matches feel urgent, like fights

**King's Road (AJPW/NOAH):**
- Structured escalation engine (base → heat → escalation → killshot phases)
- Accumulated damage tracking
- Injury risk spikes in final stages
- Crescendo psychology
- Matches feel like tragedies

**Match DNA System:** Workers carry style DNA determining:
- Expected match pacing
- Finish likelihood
- Spot choices
- Injury probabilities
- Crowd pop curves

---

### Match Presentation System

**Three Options (Player Toggle):**
1. **Straight Result:** "Goto def. Honma via GTR (15:26)"
2. **Result + Highlights:** "Goto survived a brutal headbutt barrage and countered into a sudden GTR for the win"
3. **Condensed Storyline Recap:** Paragraph-length narrative of match story

**Decision:** Full PBP deferred indefinitely (scope creep, QA nightmare, player fatigue)
