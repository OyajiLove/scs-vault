## Standard Format Verified

All mechanic files follow this structure:

```markdown
# Mechanic Name

📛 **MECHANIC:** [Name]
🔗 **PARENT SYSTEM:** [[Link to Index]]
🧭 **CATEGORY:** [Category]
🔑 **KEYWORDS:** [keywords]
📌 **ORIGIN:** [Volume reference]
✅ **STATUS:** [Locked/Conceptual]

## Overview
[Brief description]

---

## [Detailed Mechanics]
[Tables, lists, formulas]

---

## Connected Mechanics
[Links to related files]

---

## Open Questions
[Unresolved items]

---

## Implementation Notes
[JSON schema]
```

---

## Quality Indicators

### ✅ Strengths Observed

1. **Consistent Headers:** All files use emoji-prefixed metadata
2. **Wikilinks Present:** Connected mechanics properly linked
3. **JSON Schemas:** Implementation-ready data structures
4. **Historical Context:** Real-world examples throughout
5. **Open Questions:** Honest about unresolved mechanics
6. **Tables for Data:** Clean, scannable formatting

### ⚠️ Minor Notes

1. **Version History:** Index files have version history, but mechanic files generally don't (Iconic Lock is an exception with its own version table)
2. **Some Open Questions Vague:** A few files have generic "exact formula needed" without specifics
3. **Conceptual Files Well-Structured:** Even unfinished systems follow the template

## Recommendation

**No remediation needed.** Mechanic files are consistently well-structured across all sampled systems. The extraction process produced high-quality documentation.

---

## Optional Future Improvements

1. Add version history to mechanic files (not just indexes)
2. Specify formula placeholders more precisely (e.g., "needs X value from Vol Y")
3. Cross-system consistency check for JSON schema naming conventions
