## 🍳 THE HALF-BAKED TREASURES

### 1. Buzz Memory Tracker

**Source:** Vol 6 line 9, mentioned as Option 1

**Seed:** "How Buzz creates legacy events and long-term crowd recall"

**Concept:** High Buzz moments don't just affect current momentum, they create permanent memories that fans recall years later. A worker who was white-hot in 2019 might get "remember when" chants in 2024.

**Potential Mechanics:**
- Buzz threshold that triggers Memory Snapshot creation
- Memory types: viral promos, shocking returns, legendary matches
- How these memories affect future crowd reactions
- "Remember when" crowd chants for workers who've cooled off
- Legacy Buzz (distinct from current Buzz, represents historical heat)

**Potential System Connections:**
- [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz System]] - Parent system
- [[Fan Memory Engine/_Fan Memory Index|Fan Memory Engine]] - Storage and recall
- [[Crowd_Memory]] - In-match crowd behavior

---

### 2. Buzz-to-Push Converter

**Source:** Vol 6 line 9, mentioned as Option 2

**Seed:** "AI/Player system where high Buzz translates into title shots, TV time, or political leverage"

**Concept:** Formal rules for how sustained Buzz creates booking pressure. When a worker is hot, the system should push the AI (or warn the player) to capitalize, and penalize ignoring hot workers.

**Potential Mechanics:**
- Buzz thresholds that unlock booking options (e.g., Buzz 15+ = title shot eligible)
- AI Booker pressure to push high-Buzz workers
- Political leverage: high-Buzz workers can demand better spots
- TV time allocation based on Buzz rankings
- "Wasted Heat" penalty when hot workers are underbooked
- Resentment buildup when Buzz is ignored

**Potential System Connections:**
- [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz System]] - Parent system
- [[Buzz System/Push Resistance|Push Resistance]] - Political friction from ignored Buzz
- AI Booker Logic - Decision-making under Buzz pressure
- Contract Negotiations - High Buzz = leverage

---

### 3. Buzz Readout UI

**Source:** Vol 6 line 9, mentioned as Option 3

**Seed:** "Buzz charts for workers, shows, feuds, etc."

**Concept:** Visual dashboard showing Buzz trends over time. Line graphs, heat maps, comparative charts between workers or feuds.

**Potential Mechanics:**
- Worker Buzz timeline (sparkline or full chart)
- Feud Buzz comparison (both participants on same graph)
- Show Buzz heatmap (which segments were hot/cold)
- Promotion-wide Buzz overview (who's rising, who's falling)
- Historical Buzz comparison (overlay current run vs past peak)

**Potential System Connections:**
- [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz System]] - Data source
- [[UI System/_UI System Index|UI System]] - Visual presentation
- Calendar integration for temporal view

---

### 4. Buzz-Driven Push Tiers

**Source:** Vol 6 line 14, mentioned as Option 3

**Seed:** "How Buzz influences AI booking + match slots"

**Concept:** Formalized tiers where Buzz determines card position, segment allocation, and AI booking priority.

**Potential Mechanics:**
- Buzz 17-20: Main event priority, protection booking
- Buzz 13-16: Upper card, title contention eligible
- Buzz 9-12: Midcard, competitive booking
- Buzz 5-8: Lower card, building phase
- Buzz 1-4: Dark matches, repackaging candidates
- AI respects tiers (traditionalist bookers) or ignores them (chaos bookers)

**Potential System Connections:**
- [[Buzz System/_Buzz System Index|Buzz System]] - Parent system
- AI Booker Archetypes - How different bookers weight Buzz
- Match Engine - Card position assignment

---

### 5. Mock Booking Trail Planning Screen UI

**Source:** Vol 6 line 1, mentioned as next option

**Seed:** "Draft a mock Booking Trail Planning Screen (UI structure, interaction points)"

**Concept:** Full UI mockup showing how Booking Trails look in practice. Visual design for the calendar, milestone placement, drag-and-drop interaction.

**Potential Elements:**
