### 15. Historical Legacy Drift Over Time

**Source:** Vol 5 line 316, mentioned as Option B

**Seed:** "How even untouched Golden Eras slowly mutate in fan memory across generations: nostalgia distortion, revisionism."

**Concept:** Even Golden Eras that didn't collapse traumatically slowly change in collective memory over decades. What was controversial becomes classic. What was beloved becomes "overrated." Revisionism reshapes how we remember wrestling history.

**Potential Mechanics:**
- Nostalgia distortion (everything was better back then)
- Revisionist backlash (actually it wasn't that good)
- Generational discovery (new fans finding old eras)
- Documentary/retrospective effects on legacy
- "Hot take" culture reshaping narratives
- Death of key figures triggering legacy reassessment

**Historical Examples:**
- Attitude Era: Initially celebrated → "actually kinda trashy" revisionism → nostalgia resurgence
- Territory Era: Initially "the old days" → romanticized as "real wrestling"
- Hulkamania: Initially iconic → exposed as political → nostalgic icon again
- ECW: Initially cult → mainstream recognition → "actually dangerous" revisionism

**Potential System Connections:**
- [[Golden_Era_Collapse_Memory]] - Active collapse vs passive drift
- [[Golden_Era_Worker_Forging]] - Legacy tier affected by drift
- [[Hidden_Worker_Betrayal_Redemption_Memories]] - Generational memory transfer
- [[Media System]] - Documentaries trigger reassessment

## 🍳 THE HALF-BAKED TREASURES

### 1. Fanbase Revolution System

**Source:** Vol 5 line 142, mentioned as Option B

**Seed:** "How betrayed fans eventually cause creative revolutions — Austin Era, AEW Formation, etc."

**Concept:** When trust erosion reaches critical mass, fans don't just leave, they REVOLT and create demand for alternatives. This can spawn new promotions, force creative overhauls, or trigger era-defining shifts.

**Potential System Connections:**
- [[Fanbase_Trust_and_Betrayal]] - Parent system
- [[Fanbase Mutation System]] - Mutation into revolutionary state
- World events that spawn new competitors

**Historical Models:**
- Austin Era as response to New Generation malaise
- AEW formation from Elite leaving WWE/NJPW
- ECW rising from fan rejection of mainstream product

---

### 2. Belt Rehabilitation Arc Mechanics

**⬆️ PROMOTED TO LOCKED:** See `Title System/Belt_Rehabilitation_Arc.md`

**Source:** Vol 5 lines 166-169

- Historical models (IWGP, WWF, NWA, ROH)
- 2-4 year minimum recovery timelines

---

### 3. Contract Breach Fallout System

**Source:** Vol 5 line 142, mentioned as Option A

**Seed:** "How lawsuits, stripped belts, blackballing, and reputation death happen after real-world contract crises."

**Concept:** When workers breach contracts (or promotions breach them), the fallout extends beyond just "worker leaves." Legal battles, industry blacklisting, reputation damage that follows workers across promotions.

**Potential Mechanics:**
- Lawsuit duration and cost
- Industry-wide blacklisting (WWE's effective ban on signing certain workers)
- Reputation damage that affects future contract negotiations
- Media coverage affecting public perception

**Historical Models:**
- Brock Lesnar WWE/NJPW contract disputes
- CM Punk leaving WWE, legal battles
- Jeff Jarrett taking GFW belt to WCW
- Lex Luger appearing on Nitro debut

---

### 4. Ring Sanctity as Promotion-Level Stat

**Source:** Vol 5 line 140 area, mentioned in passing

**Seed:** Ring Sanctity currently exists as a setting (High/Medium/Low) but could be a tracked stat that evolves based on booking decisions.

**Concept:** Rather than just a policy, Ring Sanctity becomes a meter that rises/falls based on how the promotion treats its titles, finishes, and booking integrity.

**Potential Effects:**
- Affects worker recruitment (prestige-conscious workers avoid low sanctity feds)
- Affects fan trust baseline
- Affects belt damage severity
- Affects announcer credibility
