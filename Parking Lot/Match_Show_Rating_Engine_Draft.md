# MATCH/SHOW RATING ENGINE (Draft 0.1)

📌 **ORIGIN:** Vol 4, lines 340-610 (lines 611-927 = technical setup, not game systems)
⚙️ **STATUS:** Half-Baked (needs significant expansion)

---

## COMPANY STYLE SKEW (±20%) - LOCKED

Every promotion has a default preference that skews match rating weights.

| Company Type | Style Skew Example |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Psychology-First (AJPW 90s) | Psychology +20% |
| Spotfest Indie (PWG 2000s) | Aerial/High Spots +20% |
| TV Entertainment (WWF 1998) | Charisma/Storytelling weighted higher |
| Hardcore (ECW 1995) | Hardcore Brawling +20%, Technical +10%, Story +10% |

---

## MATCH FLAVOUR SYSTEM (NEW)

**Concept:** Booker assigns a **Flavour** to individual matches:
- Technical Showcase
- Blood Feud Brawl
- Hardcore War
- Emotional Storytelling
- High-Flying Spectacle
- Comedy
- etc.

**Key Rules:**
- Flavour ≠ Match Type (it's a thematic lens within house style)
- Flavour-Style Compatibility matters (technical flavour in deathmatch = bad)
- Worker-Flavour compatibility matters (Malenko in technical match = boost)
- Companies can emphasize different styles within their house style

**Example:** WWE 2025 is entertainment-first but can book a technical showcase between two talented workers by selecting Technical flavour.

---

## DEFAULT FLAVOUR ASSIGNMENT (LOCKED)

Match types have natural default flavours:

| Match Type | Default Flavour | Flexibility |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Hardcore/Deathmatch | Hardcore War | Very Low (~95% locked) |
| Cage Match | Brawling/Blood | Medium (can be spotfest, see Bucks vs Bros) |
| Ladder Match | Spotfest | Medium (can be storytelling, see Jericho/HBK 2008) |
| Standard Singles | Flexible | High |
| Iron Man | Technical/Endurance | Medium |

---

## CORE MATCH FLAVOURS v2.0 (14 Total)

| Flavour | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Technical Showcase | Crisp transitions, grappling, smooth holds |
| Brutal Brawl | Violence, strikes, fatigue, slow stiffness |
| Emotional Storytelling | Psychology, narrative arcs, crowd connection |
| Spotfest | Chain sequences, reversals, pacing chaos |
| Aerial War | High-flying with intent, risk-heavy, flight emphasis (≠ Spotfest) |
| Hardcore War | Chairs, tables, blood, weapon-focused |
| Deathmatch | Light tubes, skewers, glass, grotesque theatre (≠ Hardcore) |
| Comedy | Humor-forward, physical or promo comedy |
| Epic Struggle | Long, escalating narrative, multiple momentum shifts |
| Sprint | Explosive sub-10 min, all gas no filler |
| Old-School | Heat segments, heel cheating, slow builds, crowd work |
| Sports Entertainment | Gimmicks, interference, drama, storyline first |
| Shoot Style | Realism, stiffness, MMA-influenced, no frills |
| Glamour | Visual allure, sex appeal, striking beauty, presence |

**Key Distinctions:**
- Comedy = Flavour, NOT Match Type (can apply to Standard, Tag, Rumble, etc.)
- Deathmatch ≠ Hardcore (completely different crowd expectations)
- Spotfest ≠ Aerial War (Spotfest = chaos/tempo; Aerial = flight/grace)
- Standard Singles/Tag/Rumble = Flavour-neutral (all allowed except Hardcore 🟡 risky, Deathmatch 🔴 terrible)
- Street Fight/Strap/Collar = same archetype (Brutal Brawl core)

| Last Man Standing | 🟡 | ✅ | ✅ | 🔴 | 🔴 | ✅ | 🟡 | 🔴 | ✅ | 🔴 | 🟡 | 🔴 | ✅ | ✅ |

**Column Key:**
- Tech = Technical Showcase
- Spot = Spotfest
- HC = Hardcore War
- Death = Deathmatch
- Old-Sch = Old-School
- Glam = Glamour
- Sports Ent = Sports Entertainment

---

**Override System:**
- Booker CAN override default flavour
- Game warns of risk ("This flavour is extremely incompatible...")
- Success = unique memory boost ("legendary innovative match")
- Failure = craters crowd heat and legacy ("failed experimental disaster")

---

## SPECIALIST TAG UNLOCK SYSTEM (LOCKED)

Workers earn stip-specialist tags through legendary performances:

| Tag Strength | Rep Range | Bonus Impact |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Unproven (Hidden) | 0-24 | No bonus yet |
| Respected Specialist | 25-49 | Small bonus |
| Renowned Specialist | 50-74 | Medium bonus |
| Feared Master | 75-99 | Big bonus |
| Living Legend | 100+ | Huge bonus + Fan Memory Boost |

**Rules:**
- Tags visible at 25%+
- Hidden until earned
- Exception: Legacy workers start with tags (e.g., Terry Funk = Deathmatch Legend from Day 1)
- Examples: Ladder Match Icon, Deathmatch God, Cage Match Master

**Accumulation Example (Pentagon Jr.):**
1. Ladder Match Classic (MOTY) → +20 Ladder rep
2. Another 5* Ladder Match → +30 Ladder rep
3. Crosses 50 threshold → Unlocks "Ladder Match Specialist" tag
4. Bloody Cage Match → Starts building Cage rep separately
5. Years later: Ladder 75%, Hardcore 40%, Cage 50%

---

## MEDIA REPORTER BIAS

Different wrestling news outlets rate matches differently:

| Outlet | Bias |
|--------|------|
| Meltzer/Observer | Favors moves, workrate |
| DVDVR | Favors psychology, believability |
| (Others TBD) | Various biases |

This affects how matches are reported in News section, not internal ratings.

---

## MEMORY/LEGACY IMPACT

- Matches aligning with company values and clean flavour execution get remembered
- Example: Malenko/Guerrero ECW classics = enduring legacy
- Example: Rotten Brothers brawls = historical footnotes (unless cult following preserves)

---

## LEGACY/MEMORY EVOLUTION (LOCKED)

Worker and style perception mutates over decades:

**Sid Vicious Example:**
| Phase | Fan Memory |
|-------|------------|
| Initial (1991) | Monster star, over and respected |
| Workrate Shift (2000s) | Remembered as clumsy slug |
| Nostalgia Shift (2020s) | Cult status regained for charisma/spectacle |

**System:** Worker Memory Profile has Mutable Fan Perception Scores that rise, fall, or stabilize based on decade-to-decade cultural shifts.

---

## PROMOTION FLAVOUR TOLERANCE EVOLUTION (LOCKED)

Promotions change what their crowds expect over time:

| Promotion | Era | Tolerance |
|-----------|-----|----------|
| WWE | 1987 | 95% Entertainment, 5% Technical |
| WWE | 2024 | 70% Entertainment, 20% Technical, 10% Chaos |
| ECW | 1995 | Hardcore +20%, Technical +10%, Story +10% |

What a WWE crowd or NJPW crowd expects can evolve.

---

## GLAMOUR FLAVOUR CLARIFICATION

- ✅ Strong fit: Standard Singles, Tags, Rumbles, Multi-Person Showcase
- 🟡 Risky: Ladder, Cage, Deathmatch, Brawls, Ironman
- 🔴 Harmful: Shoot Style, Submission, Hardcore

---

## WORKER-FLAVOUR AFFINITY SYSTEM (LOCKED)

Not every worker thrives in every match Flavour. This simulates chemistry between worker identity and match flavour.

**Affinity Scale (0-100):**

| Range | Label | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0-19 | ❌ Clueless | Actively hurts match, worker exposed |
| 20-39 | ⚠ Miscast | Drag on flow, can be carried |
| 40-59 | 😐 Passable | Neutral |
| 60-79 | ✅ Comfortable | Adds energy, bonus to execution |
| 80-94 | ⭐ Excellent | Raises match ceiling, can carry others |
| 95-100 | 🐐 Masterclass | Defining trait, gains legacy boost |

**Affinity Tag Bonuses:**
| Tag | Bonus |
|-----|-------|
| Technical Virtuoso | +20 Affinity to Technical Showcase |
| Charisma Fountain | +15 Affinity to Emotional Storytelling or Glamour |
| Heat Magnet | +10 Affinity to Comedy, Old School, Sports Entertainment |
| Glass Cannon | May be 90+ Spotfest, 10 Brutal Brawl |
| Shooto Disciple | High Shoot Style Affinity, low in performative styles |

**Learning Curve Option:**
- Affinity can improve slowly through repeated good performances
- Cap growth based on Hidden Traits (Traditionalism, Ego, Drive)
- Failure can lock growth ("refuses to change style")

**Example:**
- MJF in Shoot Style (Affinity 35): Match feels disjointed, crowd doesn't buy it
- Emi Sakura in Glamour (Affinity 90+): Turns random midcard into memorable performance
- Ibushi in Shoot Style: High affinity (legit kickboxing background, mat work)

---

## MATCH FLAVOUR TAG UNLOCK SYSTEM (LOCKED)

Workers earn visible Tags over time based on Flavour excellence.

**Trigger:** Worker hits Flavour Affinity ≥75 → opens gate for tag unlock

**Scaling Tag Strength:**

| Tier | Threshold | Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 25% Specialist | 2-3 strong matches | Small boost |
| 50% Master | 5-6 strong performances | Moderate bonus, crowd expectation begins |
| 75% Defining | 10+ great matches | Big boost, legacy memory building |
| 100% Legend | Career-defining mastery | Major bonus, automatic crowd hype |

**Note:** Crowd hype = higher expectations. Flopping after becoming Legend hurts worse.

**Example Tags by Flavour:**

| Tag | Flavour | Examples |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Psychology Monster | Emotional Storytelling | Bret, Jake, Kawada |
| Ladder Match Specialist | Spotfest/Hardcore | Jeff Hardy, Pentagon, Sami |
| Deathmatch God | Deathmatch | Onita, Zandig, Nick Gage |
| Technical Master | Technical Showcase | Danielson, Malenko, Thatcher |
| Charisma Magnet | Glamour/Sports Ent | MJF, Mariah, Rock |
| Sprint King | Sprint | Darby, PAC, Low Ki |
| Epic Engine | Epic Struggle | Okada, Michaels, Ibushi |
| Comedy Genius | Comedy | Yano, OC, Santino |
| Shoot Style Natural | Shoot Style | Suzuki, Yamazaki, Riddle |
| Glamour Icon | Glamour | Emi Sakura, Mariah May |

**Reputation Accumulation (Under the Hood):**
- Flavour Rep Score per Worker (internal tracking)
- Crowd Memory Hooks: Great matches in big spots = faster growth
- Promo/Commentary Integration: Can accelerate tag unlocks

**Anti-Tank Safeguards:**

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Hidden Trait Resistance | High Traditionalism/low Drive may resist evolution |
| Undercutter Tag | Flopping under high expectations repeatedly |
| Flavour Crash Penalty | Stinkers in your signature flavour hurt worse |

---

## GLAMOUR ICON EXAMPLES (Corrected)

| Worker | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Shawn Michaels (1995) | Archetypal handsome, cocky, sexual charisma |
| Hiroshi Tanahashi | Japanese Ace presentation, beauty + aura |
| Yossino (Dragongate) | Lean beauty, flowing presentation, idol style |
| Mariah May | Modern glamour poster (elegance, fashion, aura) |
| Mandy Rose | Modern WWE glamour export |
| Rick Rude | Old-school "sex symbol" heel dynamic |

**Not Glamour Icons:**
- Emi Sakura: Charismatic worker, not glamour/beauty-first
- Dominik Mysterio: "Rat bastard heat" not glamour

---

## MULTI-WORKER FLAVOUR LOGIC v1.0 (LOCKED)

| Situation | Handling Rules |
|-----------|----------------|
| Tag Team (2v2) | Team evaluated collectively; lower-fit partner drags down slightly |
| Trios (3v3) | Weighted team average; two strong fits cover one miscast |
| 4v4, 5v5, Larger | Group averages weighted; extreme weak fits (0-19) still expose |
| Rumble/Battle Royal | Global average affects baseline; key moments (final 4, surprise entrants) can override |
| Main Character Focus | If 2-3 workers featured heavily, their Flavour Fit prioritized for memory building |
| Spotlight Bursts | Small moments (mini-flavours) can spike crowd heat briefly mid-chaos |

**Example (2v2 Tag):**
- Team 1: Bret Hart (Story ✅) + Owen Hart (Technical ✅)
- Team 2: Edge (Story ✅) + Christian (Comedy ✅)
- Flavour: Emotional Storytelling
- Result: Match flows naturally, slight dips when Christian dominates unless he adapts tone

**Example (Royal Rumble):**
- 30 Participants, Flavour: Epic Struggle + Sprint
- Early field with weak Flavour fits = crowd energy drops mid-match
- Strong final four or surprise ironman (e.g., Danielson) spikes legacy even if rest was sloppy

---

## ROOKIE HANDLING SYSTEM (LOCKED)

**Problem with TEW:** Rookies tank match ratings just by existing, even when booked properly.

**SCS Solution:**

| Factor | Handling |
|--------|----------|
| Rookie Overness vs Crowd Expectation | Rookies only hurt if they dominate too much relative to expectations |
| Rookie Spotlight | Too much shine without earning it = fans turn, quality suffers |
| Development Bonus | Proximity to over stars + selling well = boosts hidden learning stats |
| Match Structure Weighting | Fall guys/heat-takers have lower influence on rating unless controlling major spots |
| Heat Segments / Struggle Moments | Booking respects hierarchy = quality holds or improves |
| Learning Tree Memory | Consistent exposure to legends accelerates long-term growth (NJPW Young Lion system) |

**Rookies HELPED when:**
- Booked humbly
- Structured to struggle
- Positioned to eat falls or build sympathy
- Booked as underdogs trying their best

**Rookies HURT when:**
- Allowed to dominate heat
- Control long offensive segments against major stars
- Spotlighted way beyond fan acceptance too early

**Bad Booking Example:**
Rookie X gets long offense stretches against prime Kenny Omega → Crowd expectation shattered → Match rating drops from booking dissonance

**Good Booking Example:**
Rookie X tags in, fights valiantly, takes big offense, gets pinned clean after 2 minutes → Omega shines, rookie gets sympathy → Match rating stable, Rookie's "Growth Memory" ticks up

---

## WORKER PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT & DECLINE SYSTEM (LOCKED)

**Factors Influencing Rise & Decline:**

| Factor | Rise | Decline |
|--------|------|--------|
| Drive (Hidden) | Increases rep accumulation, conditioning | Low Drive = faster breakdown |
| Ego (Hidden) | Positive if balanced (belief = push harder) | High Ego + reckless = dumb risks, shorter prime |
| Consistency (Mental) | Helps slow decline, reps stay sharp | Inconsistent = faster decay |
| Focus (Mental) | Skill acquisition, match performance | Poor Focus = never capitalize on physical prime |
| Style | High-risk (Spotfest, Deathmatch) = faster wear | Low-risk (Technical, Old-School) ages gracefully |
| Match Frequency | Too many = faster decline | Too few = atrophy and mental rust |
| Injuries | Big accelerators of decline | Serious injuries = permanent attribute hits |
| Random Chance | Freak injuries, chronic conditions, burnout | Must exist in small degree |
| Addiction/Substance | Crashes body much faster | Energy dips, recovery collapses |
| Law/Scandal | Doesn't affect body | Ruins opportunity curve, push momentum |

**Physical Attribute Trajectory:**

| Age Range | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| 18-23 | Rapid Development possible if reps + environment strong |
| 24-30 | Peak Physical Development (Athleticism, Strength, Stamina rise) |
| 30-36 | Peak Performance Window (Physical + Mental combined) |
| 36-42 | Athleticism fades first, Strength/Durability hold depending on style |
| 42+ | Full Decline Phase unless adapted to lower-impact styles |
| 50+ | Only charisma, psychology, aura left unless freak outlier |

**Soft Caps (NOT Hard Caps):** Outliers can push through (late Tanahashi, 80s Brody, DDP, Batista)

---

## WORKER MENTAL GROWTH OVER TIME (LOCKED)

| Mental Attribute | Growth Logic |
|------------------|-------------|
| Focus | Increases slowly with experience, good mentors, booking roles |
| Composure | Built through chaos survival (big matches, travel, backstage tension) |
| Adaptability | Grows with style evolution attempts, working different territories |
| Consistency | Hardest to grow, needs high Drive + good foundational Focus |
| Psychology (Ring) | Grows sharply in late 20s/early 30s with reps against high-level opponents |
| Selling | Improves if wrestlers prioritize realism |
| Fluency (Promo) | Can be static unless trained; promo-heavy environments accelerate |
| Charisma (Aura) | Harder to grow, comes from fan connection moments or successful character arcs |

**Key Insight:** Fluency and Charisma ARE malleable, not predestined.
- Proximity to greats (Flair, Dusty, Eddie) accelerates development
- Reps matter for promo rhythm (Fluency)
- Charisma can blossom via gimmick shifts (Moxley rebirth, Austin 3:16), life changes, drive awakening

**Late Bloomer Examples:** Batista (late mental growth), Shibata (slow grind into legend), Christian (journeyman grind into elite psychology/selling)

---

## FAN MEMORY + LEGACY SHIFT SYSTEM v1.0 (LOCKED)

How workers, matches, companies, and styles are remembered, mythologized, forgotten, or rediscovered as decades pass.

**Memory Layers:**

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| Immediate Reaction | How matches/workers viewed at moment (crowd energy, show reviews) |
| Short-Term (1-3 years) | Ongoing perception, first impressions harden or soften |
| Long-Term (5-15 years) | Generational perception changes, nostalgia grows/fades |
| Legendary Moments Hook | Major shocks stick longer, become defining flashpoints |
| Style Shifts | Crowd biases change over decades |
| Mythologizing | Some become "better remembered than they actually were" (Sid, Goldberg streak) |
| Historical Rewrites | Younger generations interpret old footage differently |
| Legacy Repair | Nostalgia tours, documentaries, redemption arcs |

**Timeline-Based Perception Shifts:**

| Time Frame | Fan Memory Behavior |
|------------|--------------------|
| 0-3 Years | Immediate reactions dominate (Buzz, push momentum, scandal) |
| 3-7 Years | Narrative settling, consensus forms ("overrated," "underrated") |
| 7-15 Years | Nostalgia blooms, forgotten midcarders re-evaluated |
| 15+ Years | Mythology Era, legends enshrined, bizarre cult hero rediscoveries |

**Major Factors Influencing Fan Memory:**

| Factor | Memory Effect |
|--------|---------------|
| Match Quality | Core memory builder, consistently great matches = strong legacy |
| Style Affinity | If worker fit now-popular style in hindsight, legacy rises |
| Charisma Moments | Shock wins, promos, character work stick better than average matches |
| Scandals | Hurt memory initially; sometimes soften with time |
| Redemption Arcs | Massive boosts if fallen worker rebuilds connection |
| Nostalgia Tours/Documentaries | Boosts old reputations or creates cults of personality |
| Early Deaths/Tragedies | Martyr effect (Owen, Gino Hernandez) |
| Promotion Biases | How well company keeps footage alive affects legacy weight |

**Legacy Score System:**
Each worker has evolving Legacy Score affected by:
- Match history
- Major moments
- Fan bias changes
- Promotion media portrayal
- Nostalgia scaling
- Scandal/redemption scaling

**Legacy Trajectory Examples:**
- "Respected Midcarder" → "Cult Icon"
- "Megastar" → "Overpushed Relic"
- "Journeyman" → "Technical Genius Rediscovered"

**Real-World Legacy Arc Examples:**

| Worker | Legacy Arc |
|--------|------------|
| Macho Man | Big in era → underappreciated at retirement → mythologized now |
| Sid Vicious | Over HUGE live → mocked by workrate critics → re-appreciated for charisma/spectacle |
| Eddie Guerrero | Loved during career → martyred after death → legacy skyrocketed |
| Dean Malenko | Critical darling → gradually overshadowed by bigger personalities |
| Hulk Hogan | Over forever live → scandal drops perception → mythologized after death? TBD |

---

## MATCH QUALITY ≠ MEMORY ENDURANCE (Core Truth)

Ospreay has more 5-star matches than Misawa and Omega according to Meltzer, but his matches lack emotional staying power. "Checkbox" formula vs soul moments.

**Key Insight:** Emotional resonance, not move execution or star tally, builds legacy.

**Examples:**
- Hogan/Rock, Hogan/Andre will be remembered more than Ospreay/Takeshita in 10 years
- Danielson's final AEW run: legendary because of stakes, emotional connection, distinctiveness (Starks strap match ≠ Rush brawl ≠ ZSJ technical ≠ Omega/Swerve epics)

---

## EMOTIONAL RESONANCE SCORE (LOCKED)

Separate from Match Rating Score. Based on Crowd Energy Peak, Escalation Quality, and Worker Emotional Affinity.

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|-------------|
| Crowd Emotional Heat (Pops, Gasps, Sustained Chants) | Huge |
| Match Escalation Logic (Pacing, Breathing, Drama Peaks) | Huge |
| Worker Emotional Affinity (Selling, Storytelling, Charisma) | Huge |
| Stakes (Title, Career, Personal Vendettas) | Medium |
| Shock Moments (Turns, Betrayals, Unthinkable Comebacks) | Spike factors |
| Technical Flawlessness Alone | Low (clean work helps but not enough) |

**Emotional Resonance determines:**
- How match is remembered (legendary, great, fun, disposable, forgettable)
- How long it stays in public memory
- How it impacts worker legacies

---

## FULL MEMORY CHAIN IN SCS (LOCKED)

| Stage | What It Checks |
|-------|---------------|
| Live Reaction | Immediate Crowd + Media Pop |
| Short-Term Heat | 1-3 years (sustained memory, replay value, event buzz) |
| Emotional Resonance | Did it hit people in the heart? |
| Cultural Weight | Was it distinct, unique, soul-rooted? |
| Era Memory Drift | How future fans rediscover/reinterpret over decades |
| Promotion/Media Influence | How often companies promote, re-air, or bury |
| Myth Lock or Fade | Is it immortalized or forgotten over time? |

---

## MATCH MEMORY ANCHOR SYSTEM v1.0 (LOCKED)

How specific matches (not just workers) become legendary, forgotten, divisive, or mythic.

**Anchor Types:**

| Anchor Type | Meaning |
|-------------|--------|
| Career-Defining | Match fans associate with a worker forever |
| Era-Defining | Captures entire movement/promotion's spirit |
| Redemption Anchor | Rewrites worker's narrative after dark period |
| Mythology Builder | Grows larger than itself (e.g., Hogan/Andre) |
| Divisive Anchor | Splits fans historically (e.g., Bret/HBK Ironman) |
| Forgotten Greatness | Phenomenal but fades due to context loss |

**Anchor Memory Scoring:**

| Factor | Influence |
|--------|----------|
| Emotional Resonance Score | Primary driver |
| Cultural Distinctiveness | Must feel unique, once-in-a-generation |
| Booking Context | Big title, betrayals, era shifts boost potential |
| Worker Status at Time | Bigger stars = easier anchoring, but underdogs CAN |
| Crowd Energy Peak | Electric atmosphere locks into memory |
| Era Access Bias | Modern matches face higher decay risk (overexposure) |
| Promotion Propaganda Push | Replays, documentaries reinforce anchor |

**Practical Examples:**

| Match | Anchor Status | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Omega vs Okada I | ✅ Era + Career-Defining | Peak crowd + Story escalation + Emotional gravity |
| Misawa vs Kawada 6/3/94 | ✅ Era + Career-Defining | King's Road apex |
| Hogan vs Warrior WM6 | ✅ Mythology Builder | Technical flaws forgotten, emotional hooks eternal |
| Ospreay vs Takagi G1 2019 | 🟡 Forgotten Greatness | Amazing live, fades vs movement-defining matches |
| Rock vs Austin X7 | ✅ Career + Era-Defining | Charisma + Story + Era shift climax |
| Bret vs HBK Ironman WM12 | 🟡 Divisive | Fans split on pacing |

**Anchor Rules:**
- If you have one Career-Defining Anchor, your name stays alive longer
- If you have one Era-Defining Anchor, you become part of wrestling history
- If you miss anchoring, even 30 amazing matches can fade
- Some workers build anchors across decades (Danielson, Omega, Okada)
- Some workers never build one and drift into "great, but forgotten"

**Anchor Decay Risk:** Matches not reinforced through media replay, worker legacy boosts, nostalgia tours, documentaries decay faster unless organically rediscovered.

---

## EMOTIONAL RESONANCE SCORING (Detailed Weights)

| Factor | Description | Weight |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Live Crowd Emotional Energy | Pops, gasps, chants, silences, sustained reactions | High |
| Escalation Rhythm | Clear progression, dramatic pacing, big moment payoff | High |
| Worker Emotional Performance | Selling, facial expressions, body language, sympathy | High |
| Story Context | Long feud payoff, redemption arcs, betrayal, legacy | Medium-High |
| Booking Stakes | Title, career, legacy, life-defining moment | Medium |
| Match Length/Pacing Appropriateness | Does it breathe? Do moments land properly? | Medium |
| Post-Match Fallout | Crowd reaction, aftermath promo, media buzz | Low-Medium |
| Promo Lead-In | How much emotional investment existed walking in | Low-Medium |

**Rule:** Matches excelling in 4-5+ categories and scoring high in top 3 = high Emotional Resonance (Legendary)

**Example Scoring (Omega vs Okada I):**

| Factor | Notes | Score |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Live Crowd Reaction | Constant awe, standing ovation | ✅ |
| Escalation Rhythm | Near-perfect across 45+ minutes | ✅ |
| Emotional Performance | Omega's struggle + Okada's stoicism | ✅ |
| Story Context | Okada's reign, Omega's rise, Bullet Club layers | ✅ |
| Booking Stakes | IWGP title, legitimacy of gaijin ace | ✅ |
| Match Length Appropriateness | Widely praised, minimal bloat | ✅ |
| Post-Match Fallout | Immediate legend status | ✅ |
| Promo Lead-In | Strong, but match itself carried most emotion | 🟢 |

**Final Emotional Resonance: High (Legendary)**

## PROMOTION PROPAGANDA ENGINE v1.0 (LOCKED)

How promotions shape, manipulate, or erase fan memory over time.

**Key Concepts:**

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|--------|
| Narrative Control | Promotions with strong media presence control what fans remember |
| Historical Prioritization | Some matches/workers pushed on DVDs, Network specials; others vanish |
| Brand Myth Building | "WWE Icons," "Four Pillars," marketing constructs not always accurate |
| Fan Indoctrination Rate | New fans adopt official narrative unless exposed to alternatives |
| Footage Ownership = Memory Control | Owning tape libraries = elevate or bury whoever you want |

**Mechanics:**

| System Layer | Mechanic |
|--------------|----------|
| Promotion Legacy Agenda | Each company has profile of workers/matches they push, suppress, ignore |
| Historical Spotlight System | Video packages, retrospectives, booking references, title history promos |
| Re-air & Replay Rate | Repeated matches build stronger anchors even if not legendary live |
| Footage Loss/Suppression | Lost tapes or inactive promotions cause memory decay |
| Narrative Bias Tags | Internal "Priority" tags ("Icon of the Brand," "Official Narrative Champion") |
| Competing Narratives | Multiple promotions fight over how jumped/retired workers remembered |
| Scandal Memory Suppression | Some workers edited out post-scandal (Benoit-level erasure logic) |

**Real-World Examples:**

| Case | Propaganda Behavior |
|------|---------------------|
| WWE pushing Triple H as Austin/Rock equal | Official branding, documentary positioning, endless video packages |
| TNA burying Raven, Jerry Lynn | Legacy quietly erased despite foundational importance |
| WCW Vader vs Cactus matches | Lost footage removed incredible brawls from mainstream memory |
| AEW "Founding Fathers" canon | Page, Omega, Bucks, Cody mythologized; others de-emphasized |

**Mechanical Outputs:**

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Worker Legacy Inflation/Deflation | Memory score rises/fades artificially due to propaganda exposure frequency |
| Match Memory Anchor Boosts | Matches replayed/referenced gain emotional weight over time |
| Fan Bias Formation | New fans under strong propaganda learn curated history |
| Media Echo Effect | Commentators, video packages, interviews shape perception |

---

## ANTI-PROPAGANDA & FAN MEMORY RESISTANCE ENGINE v1.0 (LOCKED)

How fans, subcultures, documentarians, shoot interviews challenge official history.

**Key Layers:**

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| Independent Memory Circles | Alternative memory hubs around buried legends, lost classics |
| Documentary Influence Layer | Third-party docs (Dark Side of the Ring, Deadlock) challenge canon |
| Fan Reappraisal Waves | New generations rediscover old workers/styles, reframe importance |
| Scandal Reframing Logic | Some disgraced workers partially re-evaluated based on severity + time |
| Cult Worker Memory Locks | Passionate niche fanbases never let workers be truly forgotten |
| Tag-Driven Resurrection | "Cult Legend," "Forgotten Genius," "Buried Innovator" flags for revival |
| Shoot Interview Memory Damage | Veteran trash-talk or revelations elevate/tear down canonized figures |

**Mechanics:**

| System | Mechanic |
|--------|----------|
| Underground Legacy Score | Hidden secondary memory tracker (shoot discourse, rare replays, community lore) |
| Fanbase Activism Ticks | Cult figure gains traction via docs, reuploads, indie tributes → legacy shifts |
| Scandal Flex Curve | Based on Morality, Promotion Bias, Time Passed |
| Documentary Event Triggers | Fan-made docs, shoot drops, "20 years later" pieces boost visibility |
| Generational Memory Drift | Every 10-15 years, younger fanbase rediscovers/reframes heroes |
| Media Bias Tension | Friction between company narrative and underground truth |

**Resistance Tags:**

| Tag | What It Unlocks |
|-----|----------------|
| Cult Legend | High underground memory score, used in tributes, podcasts, indie inspiration |
| Forgotten Genius | Once buried, now slowly rediscovered (often post-retirement/posthumously) |
| Buried Innovator | Technically/stylistically influential but politically erased |
| Controversial Truth-Teller | Raises others' legacies, shatters myths |
| Cancelled Immortal | Never canonized but never forgotten (e.g., Benoit) |

**Real-World Examples:**

| Worker/Match | Promotion Narrative | Fan Re-Evaluation |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Chris Candido | Forgotten post-ECW | Deadlock, retrospectives, podcasts elevated to cult icon |
| Raven in TNA | Barely mentioned | Shoot interviews + online tape culture → slow rediscovery |
| Jerry Lynn | Quietly erased by TNA/WWE | Cult darling by fan collectors and ROH fans |
| Dark Side of the Ring | N/A | Rewrote who mattered and how people were broken |
| Triple H as Austin/Rock peer | WWE narrative machine | Educated fans know better: clear tier down despite media push |
| Undertaker's Workrate | Myth: superworker | Reality: carried often, character legendary; fans parsing truth |

## ERA-DEPENDENT ACCESS TO HISTORY (LOCKED)

| Era | Access & Effects |
|-----|------------------|
| 1970s-Early 90s | Footage scarce. Knowledge gatekept by newsletter readers, tape traders. Promotions control narratives. Fan Memory = hard to challenge. |
| Mid 90s-2000s (DVD Era) | Slow democratization. RF Video, ROH/ECW VHS/DVDs, shoot interviews give tools to reframe. |
| 2007-2015 (YouTube/Forums Era) | Mass historical correction. Fans uploading handhelds, rare territory footage. Deadlock/OSW retrospectives rewrite canon. |
| 2015-Present | Total access culture. Myths fall faster. Cult icons resurrected faster. But disposability also rises. |

**Rule:** Fan Memory System has Era-Adjusted Discovery Modifier. Earlier eras = propaganda stickier, rediscovery rarer. Later eras = higher resistance potential but more noise.

---

## LEGACY TAGS CATEGORY (LOCKED)

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Cult Legend | Elevated by niche fans, not officially canonized but never forgotten |
| Forgotten Genius | Technically great or ahead of their time, rediscovered later |
| Buried Innovator | Pioneered styles/techniques, erased politically or circumstantially |
| Controversial Truth-Teller | Shoot interviewer, memoirist who reshaped other legacies |
| Cancelled Immortal | Legacy erased by promotions but mythologized by fan subcultures (e.g., Benoit) |

**Influences:** Fan narrative discussions, Hall of Fame debates, Documentary angles, Cult promotion interest, Booking nostalgia tours

| Shoot Style | Revived every 15-20 years by purists |

**How Style Mutation Happens:**

| Event | Outcome |
|-------|--------|
| Oversaturation | Popularity declines, crowd burnout |

## WORKER-BOOKER RELATIONSHIP MEMORY SYSTEM v1.0 (LOCKED)

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| Booking Trust Score | Tracks how much a worker trusts their booker over time |
| Push Delivery Memory | Remembers if promises (title runs, big angles) were delivered or broken |
| Sabotage Resentment | Burial matches, broken streaks leave hidden anger memory |
| Golden Child Bias | Workers feel favoured/unfavoured based on booking consistency |
| Paranoia Triggers | High-Paranoia workers feel slighted even during minor miscommunications |
| Forgiveness Curve | Hidden trait lets some workers forgive bad booking faster; others never forget |
| Shock Turnarounds | Buried worker suddenly trusted can cause loyalty surges or permanent suspicion |

**Key Mechanics:**

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|--------|
| Promise Memory | Title shot promised? Big angle promised? Worker remembers even if fans forget |
| Public vs Private Loyalty | May stay professional outwardly but sabotage angles, kill promos, tank matches |
| Loyalty Tag Accumulation | "Company Soldier," "Resentful Lifer," "Burned Wanderer" tied to booking history |
| Contract Negotiation Impact | Trust level modifies demands, re-sign likelihood, sabotage risk |
| Paranoia Reactions | Low-trust, high-paranoia workers panic, politic, lash out in media |

**Worker Loyalty Archetypes (Emergent):**

| Type | Notes |
|------|-------|
| True Company Soldier | Always loyal, accepts downs, rides highs (rare unless trust history consistent) |
| Paranoid Politicker | Watches booking patterns, lashes out at slights (real or imagined) |
| Opportunistic Wanderer | Jumps for better booking/money, no real loyalty |
| Bitter Veteran | Trust eroded after years, drags down talent, explodes publicly eventually |
| Golden Child | Given consistent respect, may become lazy if too pampered |

---

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| Feud Emotional Memory Bank | Tracks crowd heat, betrayal moments, title changes, legacy impact per feud |
| Feud Length Risk Curve | Too long without emotional evolution = crowd patience erodes, memory decays |
| Historic Feud Anchors | Legendary feuds (Flair/Funk, Rock/Austin) stored with Era Weight, boost both workers permanently |

| Heat Fatigue Risk | Hot feuds too long without resolution can collapse and hurt both trajectories |
| Fan Reappraisal of Feuds | Some feuds get better/worse in hindsight as era context shifts |

**Key Mechanics:**

| Mechanic | Details |
|----------|--------|
| Emotional Resonance Growth Curve | Feuds that escalate emotionally (betrayal, faction collapse) build memory stronger |
| Burnout Tracker | Tracks if crowd grows bored by repetition (too many rematches, no evolution) |
| Shock Feud Revival Potential | Long-cold feuds can spark years later if promos/angles reignite stakes |
| Blow-Off Match Memory Lock | Perfect ending (stip payoff, real closure) = emotional anchor for both workers |
| Disastrous Blow-Off Fallout | Bad finish = short-term reaction penalties and longer memory decay |

**Worker/Booker + Feud Interlock:**

| Interaction | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Booking Trust Shapes Feud Willingness | Betrayed workers may refuse or tank feuds even if booking is logical |
| Great Feuds Cement Worker Loyalty | Hot feuds that pay off elevate trust for worker and booker |
| Bad Booking Erodes Feud Potential | Cold booking → cold crowd → fatigue faster |
| Personal Resentments Fuel Hot Feuds | Real anger = magic but also backstage explosions |
| Legacy Building Requires Patience | Booking patience + payoff builds feuds that live decades in memory |

---

## WORKER EMOTIONAL ARC MEMORY SYSTEM v1.0 (LOCKED)

The system that remembers not just career paths, but emotional lives.

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| Emotional Milestone Memory | Accumulates scars, triumphs, betrayals, redemptions, losses of faith |
| Fan Emotional Alignment Drift | Connection grows, cools, resurrects, or dies based on emotional trajectory |
| Self-Perception Drift | Worker's view of self changes based on outcomes, injuries, betrayals |
| Personal Redemption and Collapse Potential | Workers can sink into cynicism/madness or claw back with redemption |
| Narrative Anchor Creation | Major emotional arcs become permanent memory score and crowd association |
| Reluctant Alliances, Tragic Rivalries | Past feuds remembered, add emotional weight to new situations |
| Match/Promo Emotional Imprinting | Leave permanent tags: "Broken Hero," "Corrupted Idealist," etc. |

**Hangman Page Example (AEW):**

| Arc Phase | Emotional Milestone |
|-----------|--------------------|
| The Anointed One (2019) | "Next Up" prospect, didn't fully connect yet |
| The Broken Champion (2020) | Anxiety, alcohol crutch, insecurity sharpened into believable aura |
| The Forgotten Son (2021) | Left adrift, builds fan sympathy |
| The Returning Hero (2022) | Organic reconnection, triumph earned by slow burn |
| The Shattered Cowboy (2023) | Loss to Swerve, home invasion, mental degradation, violent desperation |
| The Broken Man Rebuilding (2025) | Seeking redemption but scarred forever |

**Worker Emotional Memory Traits (Gained Over Time):**

| Trait | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Broken Hero | Once loved, fell hard, still carries tattered dignity |
| Cynical Survivor | Believes only betrayal is real, fights without hope |
| Corrupted Idealist | Started pure, compromised too many times |
| Grieving Veteran | Lost too many, fights ghosts more than opponents |
| Rebuilding Soul | Trying to find meaning again after collapse |
| Hollow Legend | Remembered by fans, but privately dead inside |
| Fragile Hope | Still wants to believe, one more betrayal could end it |

---

## CORE EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE RULES (LOCKED - FOUNDATIONAL)

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Organic Emotional Arcs Must Be Possible | Player can build slow, painful arcs that explode into magic |
| Impossible to Force or Exploit | No "cheap" emotional cheat codes, must balance risk with reward |
| Fans Must Choose To Feel | System tracks crowd buy-in, sympathy swings, forgiveness curves |
| Planning, Patience, Adaptation Required | Months or years of in-game time to build emotional journeys |
| Talent Matters | Workers need minimum emotional resonance traits, charisma, adaptability |
| Hidden Trait Modifiers | Traits modify worker behavior, promo impact, crowd reactions during arcs |

**Enforcement Mechanics:**

| System | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Crowd Emotional Memory Building | Only builds through consistent matches, promos, setbacks, betrayals (NOT instant booking decisions) |
| Promo Authenticity Modifier | Worker emotional resonance + current trait affects believability; forced promos = lower impact |
| Worker Charisma/Sympathy Floor | If worker lacks natural emotional affinity, arc fizzles regardless of booking |
| Tension Fatigue Curve | Fans tire if arcs dragged too long without escalation or breathing |
| True Payoff Risk | Climax too early = burns journey; too late = bores crowd; perfect timing = rare, precious |
| Fan Ownership of Resolution | Fans feel they helped shape the arc, remember the suffering, hope, betrayal, tears |

**Additional Principles:**

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Audience Tension + Resolution Cycles | Arcs must ride natural emotional waves (hope, doubt, hate, catharsis), not constant forward momentum |
| Fan Revolt Risk if Mishandled | Forcing emotional payoff before fans ready = rejection (boo face wins, chant for wrong guy) |
| Once-in-a-Lifetime Feeling Possible | If perfectly booked and executed, arcs create career/era-defining matches |

---

## ROAD AGENT HINT SYSTEM (LOCKED)

Hidden emotional traits not viewable in worker profiles, but good road agents can hint at evolutions.

**Good Road Agents will:**
- Pick up on emotional trait evolutions ("I think he's breaking inside... lean into that")
- Suggest emotional opportunities ("Fans want to believe in her again. It's faint, but real.")
- Warn of emotional decay ("He's losing them. It's not about wins anymore.")

**Bad/Disengaged Road Agents will:**
- Miss hints entirely
- Offer generic advice
- Mislead based on personal bias

**Rule:** Players never have full vision into worker's emotional soul. Great agents give clues.

---

## BOOKING PATTERN MEMORY AND FAN SABOTAGE SYSTEM v1.0 (LOCKED)

| System | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Booking Pattern Memory | Fans track show-to-show, feud-to-feud, year-to-year patterns |
| Booking Redundancy Detection | Too predictable = fans feel it subconsciously |
| Fan Patience Erosion Curve | Shows decline in energy even if matches stay good |
| Sabotage Reactions | Fans boo faces, cheer heels, chant for rivals, reject planned payoffs |
| Anti-Fanbuilding Threshold | Bad enough = matches/angles self-sabotaged live |
| Long-Term Memory Decay | Booking laziness = legacy damage even for good shows |

**Phases:**

| Phase | Trigger |
|-------|--------|
| Recognition | Fans notice same match types, finishes, promos, feud layouts repeating |
| Fatigue | Shows feel "long" or "forgettable" despite good work |
| Sabotage | Fans openly reject booking (hijacking chants, booing feel-good moments) |
| Collapse | Top feuds stop drawing, title prestige decays, crowd energy flattens |
| Redemption (Possible) | Massive booking shift, new stars, genuine arcs gradually rebuild trust (months/years) |

**Patterns That Decay Fan Trust:**

| Pattern | Why It Hurts |
|---------|--------------|
| Formula Finishes | Same DQ run-ins, distractions, interference every week |
| Hotshotting Titles | No emotional build, hot-potato booking erodes stakes |
| "Can They Coexist" Tag Angles | Overused forced alliances with no real emotional groundwork |
| Face/Heel Whiplash | Turns without character evolution, fans feel manipulated |
| Redundancy in Match Type | Endless tags, endless hardcore, endless sprints without story |
| Ignoring Crowd Trends | Fans organically favor someone, booking resists = resentment |
| Endless Rematches | No evolution in matches or story, just padding |

**Sabotage Reactions:**

| Fan Action | Trigger |
|------------|--------|
| Hijacking Chants | "We Want X," "This is Boring," "You Deserve Better" |
| Booing Planned Babyfaces | Crowd refuses emotional manipulation |
| Cheering Villains | Embrace rulebreakers out of spite |
| Cold Crowd Death | Dead silence during supposed emotional peaks |
| Organic Replacements | Fans push new faces (e.g., Bryan 2013) regardless of plans |
| Viewership/Energy Drop | TV ratings, attendance, crowd warmth collapse |

---

## SURGERY DECISION SYSTEM (LOCKED)

| Factor | Influence |
|--------|----------|
| Promotion Support | Does company cover surgery? (Rare in US indies, more common Japan/Mexico) |
| Wealth/Salary | Top stars afford private care; jobbers can't |
| National Healthcare | Canada, Japan, UK, Australia = universal healthcare (easier access, slower timelines) |
| Hidden Personality Traits | Drive, Ego, Future Planning, Morality influence decision to risk damage or delay |
| Desperation Tags | "Can't Lose My Spot" = hide injuries, work hurt, rush back early |
| Financial Aid Requests | Beg owners (depends on Owner Personality: Generous, Ruthless, Image-Obsessed) |
| Fan-Funded Campaigns | Generic crowdfunding if desperate; success depends on popularity, scandal risk, sympathy |

**Generic Crowdfunding Names (NOT wrestling-specific):**
- FundTogether
- CarePool
- Solidarity Support
- BridgeFund
- LifeBack

**Example Scenario:**
- Indie midcarder, Canadian, tears ACL
- Surgery timeline in Canada: 9-12 month wait if public system
- Cannot afford US private care out-of-pocket
- Requests financial aid from major company: Denied (Owner is Cheap personality)
- Forced to launch crowdfunding, semi-successful because fans respect workrate
- Recovery delayed; re-injures meniscus compensating during return
- Emotional arc becomes about pain, resilience, forgotten dream... or tragic burnout

---

## WORKER RETIREMENT AND POST-CAREER MEMORY SYSTEM v1.0 (LOCKED)

**Why Workers Retire (Realistic Paths):**

| Retirement Path | How It Happens |

| Commentator or Manager | Personality workers transition naturally |
| Company Executive | Very rare, requires elite charisma + backstage politic experience |
| Podcast/Media Personality | Common modern retirement, shoot interviews, podcast circuits |
| Complete Civilian Life | Disappears from wrestling entirely, risk of being forgotten |
| Political or Activist Life | Unions, political activism (based on strong Morality/Future Planning tags) |
| Tragic Spiral | Addiction, mental health collapse, bankruptcy, or early death |

**Legacy Drift Post-Retirement:**

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Documentary Features | Nostalgia spikes, rediscovery boosts memory score |
| Fan-Led Rediscovery | Cult followings grow via podcasts, retrospectives |
| Hall of Fame Inductions | Solidify top-tier memory (even if HOFs are propaganda machines) |
| Booking Nostalgia Runs | Risk of feeling cheap if overdone or poorly used |
| Personal Scandals | Post-retirement scandals kill legacy momentum fast (even after death) |
| Redemption Arcs | Former scandals forgiven if redemption feels earned |

**Mechanical Summary:**

| System | Effect |
|--------|--------|

| Influence on Younger Workers | Trainers/mentors pass stylistic DNA and hidden bonuses to trainees |
| Return Matches | Un-retire occasionally, successful or disastrous depending on body/memory status |

## TALENT DEVELOPMENT PATHWAYS SYSTEM v1.0 (LOCKED)

**What We Simulate:**

| Reality | How We Simulate |
|---------|-----------------|
| Rookie Evolution | Talent grows, stagnates, adapts, or collapses (not fixed at debut) |
| Opportunity Bias | Some workers never reach potential because no one books them properly |
| Work Ethic vs Luck | Hard work helps, but booking opportunity, crowd acceptance, life events also play heavy roles |
| Trainer Influence | Who trains massively impacts style, mental attributes, psychology, safety, emotional storytelling |
| Breakout or Plateau | Some surge into stars, others burn bright early and plateau |
| Pressure Handling | Mental strength, ego, loyalty, paranoia modify whether they thrive or self-destruct |
| Early Physical Breakdown | High-risk styles + bad luck can wreck rookies before they peak (Dynamite Kid, Hayabusa) |

**Talent Growth Systems:**

| Growth Type | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| Organic Skill Growth | Bell-to-Bell, Mental, Entertainment skills grow through match reps, promo reps, feud exposure, travel |
| Opportunity Multipliers | Title matches, main events, major feuds boost development faster |
| Mentor/Territory Bonus | Great trainers/territory booking improve fundamentals exponentially |
| Injury/Burnout Risk | Pushed too fast without resilience = physical and emotional burnout |
| Match Experience Quality | High-rated matches train better; stinkers hurt confidence |
| Fan Sympathy Boosters | Struggle arcs accelerate crowd bond and charisma growth if booked wisely |

**Talent Collapse Systems:**

| Collapse Type | Trigger |
|---------------|---------|
| Injury-Caused Talent Loss | Severe injuries destroy athleticism, stamina, durability permanently |
| Mental Collapse | Pressure, scandal, betrayal break Focus, Composure, Consistency |
| Booking Misuse | Go-nowhere feuds, 50/50 booking, endless jobber matches destroy confidence |
| Toxic Mentor Influence | Bad trainers instill dangerous styles, lack of safety, bad psychology habits |
| Early Overpush Damage | Workers pushed before ready plateau early or face permanent fan backlash |

**Special Talent Arcs (Emergent):**

| Arc | Example |

| Late Bloomer Redemption | Overlooked early, finds right mentor or feud, rises organically (DDP, Batista) |
| Indie Worker Cult Growth | Stuck in small promotions, builds cult legend through match quality |
| Golden Rookie Burnout | Overpushed too fast, fan resentment, collapses emotionally |
| Road Dog Survivor | Never a top star but adapts, builds consistency, becomes valuable agent |

---

## MATCH AND PROMO BOTCH SYSTEM v1.0 (LOCKED)

| Botch Type | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Match Botches | Blown spots, missed finishes (Hebner 3-count issues), visibly bad calls |
| Promo Botches | Forgotten lines, stumbles, wrong cue reads, dead air |
| Debut Botches | Shockmaster-style legendary disasters if wrong worker/agent/setup |
| Angle Physical Botch | Tripping, costume failures, missed attacks, cable trips |
| Post-Botch Sympathy or Death | Some recover (self-deprecating promos, redemption); some die instantly (burial, mockery) |

**Real-World Examples:**
- Earl Hebner's 3-count botches (Rock/Angle No Way Out 2001)
- Shockmaster debut disaster
- Goofy physical botches in angles (tripping over cables, etc.)

**Rule:** Botches don't just hurt matches. They haunt or bless debuts, angles, careers, shows forever.

---

## CROSS-PROMOTION TALENT EXCHANGE AND TERRITORY INVASION SYSTEMS v1.0 (LOCKED)

**Talent Exchange System:**

| Exchange Type | How It Works |
|---------------|-------------|
| Mutual Benefit | Both promotions agree to share talent for fresh matchups, cross-promotion shows, skill building |
| Touring Apprenticeship | Rookies sent abroad to gain experience (NJPW → Mexico, US workers to Japan) |
| Short-Term Storyline Loans | Workers sent to spice up cold shows or fill cards after injuries |
| Emergency Alliances | Promotions in financial trouble lend/rent talent to survive (early TNA using AAA, NOAH sending workers) |
| Star Poaching Agreements | Backdoor deals where "borrowed" workers subtly nudged into jumping permanently |

**Territory Invasion System:**

| Invasion Type | How It Works |
|---------------|-------------|
| Open Invasion | Workers arrive cutting "outsider" promos, attacking champs, claiming territory |
| Silent Infiltration | Workers show up humble, slowly take over booking attention, angles, titles |
| Full Takeover Attempt | Invaders become main-eventers, champions; natives must defend pride |
| Promoter Betrayal Invasions | Promoters cooperate secretly, then one pulls the rug |
| Failure/Sabotage Risks | Bad invasions collapse: fans reject outsiders, angles feel cold, locker room resentment |

**Worker Jump/Betrayal Memory:**

| Betrayal Type | Fan Reaction |
|---------------|-------------|
| Title Jump Betrayal | Worker leaves with active title, fans furious or thrilled depending on narrative heat |
| Turncoat Betrayal | Worker stabs old home in promos, joins hated rival (Lex Luger, Rick Rude) |
| Quiet Contract Expiration | Worker vanishes, no closure; fans forget quickly or mythologize |
| Work-to-Shoot Betrayal | Simulated betrayal into real work-shoot angles |

**Cultural Legacy of Invasions:**

| Outcome | Fan Memory |
|---------|------------|
| Legendary War | Masterfully handled, creates multi-year feuds, dream matches (NWO early years) |
| Mutual Growth | Both promotions and fanbases benefit (NJPW-CMLL alliance) |
| Bitter Collapse | One promotion gutted, fanbase dies, recorded as betrayal era |
| Forgotten Experiments | Cold invasions fans forget after 6 months |

---

## TERRITORY RAIDS VS NATURAL MIGRATION VS ACQUISITION (LOCKED)

| Situation | How It Behaves in SCS |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Natural Talent Migration | Workers jump willingly, no hard feelings unless framed badly; possible to stay friendly |
| Predatory Raiding | Workers lured by bigger money/TV/creative freedom; old promotions collapse, fanbases resent |
| Company Acquisition/Invasion Fusion | Buying a dying promotion allows booking cross-promotional wars, brand supremacy feuds, internal invasions even if owned by same entity |

**Rule:** You can own both companies and still run a blood feud storyline between them. In-world fans don't always know ownership details; they feel pride of old banners, legacies, styles at war.

**Real-World Examples:**

| Case | Simulation |
|------|------------|
| Vince raids AWA, JCP, Stampede | True territory raids: ruthless talent stealing, bigger money and TV time |
| WCW NWO "Invasion" | Fictional invasion sold as reality, lawsuit risks optional |
| Choshu invasion of AJPW | Outsiders arrive hot, alter booking landscape, push new legends |
| AJPW lending Kawada to NJPW | Desperate lending for relevance after mass exodus, booking protection negotiated |
| AEW and NJPW modern co-promotion | Tense collaboration, big matches booked cautiously, betrayal risk always present |
| CZW vs ROH | Cooperative yet real blood feud, backstage tension mirrors promotion pride |
| WWE predatory practices (2024-25) | Jeff Cobb pulled before NJPW knew, Vaquer snatched from CMLL, British scene gutted, AAA swallowed |

## TALENT BUYOUTS AND CONTRACT CONSIDERATIONS (LOCKED)

| Step | Mechanic |
|------|----------|
| Negotiate Buyouts | Pay heavy cash to buy out existing contracts or insurance policies |
| Match Creative Control Demands | Top stars demand booking protection, no burial, title runs, no heel turns |
| Handle Fan Perception Carefully | Botching invasion (burying top guys immediately) kills fan trust and memory |
| Offer Public Narratives | Smart PR frames signings as "stars proving themselves" rather than "mercenary cash grabs" |

**Rule:** No automatic wins. You have to pay, plan, deliver. True to life.

## CREATIVE HOT STREAK SYSTEM v1.0 (LOCKED)

**Momentum Tracking:**

| Layer | How It Works |
|-------|-------------|
| Booking Trust Memory | Fans track recent weeks' emotional payoffs, betrayals, title changes, feud peaks |
| Emotional Resonance Curve | If multiple shows escalate crowd investment without collapse, emotional energy builds |
| Narrative Freshness Tracker | Booking must feel varied, creative; not repeating patterns |
| Worker Usage Spread | Over-relying on 1-2 workers without elevating others risks burnout |

**Hot Streak Activation:**

| Trigger | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| 5-7 Weeks of High Emotional Resonance | Crowds invest deeper, shows feel "must-watch" |
| Booking Memory Trust Level Reaches Threshold | Fans forgive minor booking mistakes temporarily |
| Media Buzz Activates | Fictional press, newsletters start praising promotion's golden age |
| Worker Morale Rises | Backstage excitement increases, better promos, fewer no-shows |

**Hot Streak Benefits:**

| Layer | Boost |
|-------|-------|
| Natural Crowd Warmth | Higher base pop levels at start of matches |
| Feud Accelerators | Heats rise faster, fans invest in smaller emotional beats |
| Merchandise Spikes | Hot streak eras = merchandise explosions |
| Worker Development Buff | Rookies and midcarders grow faster during hot streaks |
| Booking Memory Buffer | Fans tolerate fumbles for a few weeks longer |
| Legacy Seeds | Big matches have higher chance of becoming legacy memory anchors |

**Hot Streak Collapse Triggers:**

| Collapse Cause | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| Overexposure of Top Stars | Running Austin/Rock into ground drains novelty |
| Lazy Booking Patterns | Same matches, finishes, segment styles burn out fans |
| Creative Overcomplication | Higher Power Swerves, Russo Booking = audience exhaustion |
| Locker Room Fractures | Workers burned out, backstabbing, promo coherence drops |
| External Scandals | Drug busts, assault cases shatter emotional momentum |
| World Events | Wars, disasters, economic crashes lower audience emotional bandwidth |

**Legacy Aftermath:**

| Result | Memory |
|--------|--------|
| Sustained Hot Streak (6-12+ Months) | Promotion locks in "Golden Era" memory, talked about decades later |
| Brief Hot Streak (2-5 Months) | Feels mythic to hardcore fans, casuals forget unless archived |
| Catastrophic Collapse | Great eras can be retroactively tainted if collapse is scandalous (WCW 2000) |

**Real-World Example (1999 WWF Top Card):**

| Week | Event | Creative Memory |
|------|-------|----------------|
| March | Rock's face cracks emerge | Crowds start buying in |
| April | Stephanie kidnapped, Vince redeems himself | Massive sympathy surge |
| Late April | Monster truck attack, Austin saves Steph | Mythmaking |
| May | Corporate Ministry merges, Vince punched Shane | Fans buzzing |
| June | Higher Power reveal (lol) | Collapse begins, but golden run already locked in memory |

## ERA-DEPENDENT HEALTH AND LONGEVITY MODIFIERS (LOCKED)

| Era | Health Curve Reality |
|-----|---------------------|
| 1970s-Early 90s | Early wear and tear peaks by early 30s. Severe health risks from minor injuries. Few preventative interventions. |
| Mid 90s-2000s | Sports medicine begins improving. Rehab becomes "a thing." Diet/training marginally better. Early adopters (DDP) extend life and careers. |
| 2010s-2020s | Elite-level knowledge widespread. Preventative treatments possible. Recovery from major surgeries faster. Mental health normalization helps. |
| Future Era (Post-2025) | High-end stars (rich, disciplined) can maintain near-peak conditioning into late 40s with correct behavior. Middle/low-tier still risk decay without access. |

**Formula:** Era + Personality + Wealth + National Healthcare = full career health curve

**Factors Influencing Modern Worker Longevity:**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Drive Rating | How much effort into diet, rehab, preventative care |
| Access to Wealth/Healthcare | Private sports therapy or government-provided healthcare speeds recovery |
| Lifestyle Tags | "Party Animal," "Chronic Drinker," "Steroid Abuse History" accelerate decay |
| Adaptability Skill | Ability to modify style, cut bump-heavy sequences, work smarter |
| Injury Luck | Some injuries still end careers no matter the preparation |
| Booking Pressure | If promotion overuses workers during Hot Streaks, decay accelerates (Cena syndrome) |

## TAG TEAM AND FACTION CORE SYSTEMS v1.0 (LOCKED - IN PROGRESS)

**Why They Matter:**
- Wrestling history IS faction history
- Friendships, betrayals, loyalty tests = emotional fuel
- Great factions create stars (Horsemen, Evolution, DX, Shield, Elite)
- Tag legacies become career-defining (Steiners, Midnight Express, Bucks)
- Faction wars drive entire eras (nWo, Bullet Club, Corporate Ministry, Bloodline)

**Formation Systems:**

| Formation Type | How It Happens |
|----------------|---------------|
| Organic Chemistry Spark | High chemistry workers naturally align |
| Booking-Forced Alliance | Booker puts together for strategic reasons; may succeed or backfire |
| Backstage Friendships | Strong private relationships (loyalty memory) lobby for creation |
| Shared Goals/Styles | Similar styles, gimmicks, or ambitions lead to organic alliance |
| Corporate/Political Formations | Promotions "assign" groups; often unstable but can catch fire |
| Outside Circumstance | Trainees together, desperate alliances, post-feud respect |

**Chemistry and Internal Dynamics:**

| Chemistry Layer | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| In-Ring Chemistry | Move timing, saves, hot tags, teamwork spots boost match ratings |
| Promo Chemistry | How natural they feel in interviews, group promos |
| Backstage Relationship Health | Hidden loyalty scores; tension builds if resentment, ego, paranoia rise |
| Faction Hierarchy Compatibility | Alpha struggles, jealousy, respect influence group health |
| Growth or Suppression Risk | Midcarders can rise (if supported) or stagnate (if hogged by leaders) |

**Booking and Momentum Systems:**

| Booking Factor | Effect |
|----------------|--------|
| Group Push Momentum | Winning faction wars, title dominance boosts all member popularity |
| Sacrifice Booking | Underlings fed to leader can gain rub or decay if too sacrificial |
| Tag Title Booking | Good runs boost chemistry; bad booking erodes momentum |
| Faction Feuds | Properly structured wars can launch multiple solo careers |
| Failure to Evolve | Long-term stasis burns crowd interest fast |

**Breaking Up Systems:**

| Breakup Type | Fan Reaction |
|--------------|-------------|
| Organic Drift Apart | Gimmick shift, natural growing apart. If slow and logical, fan memory often softens positively |
| Heel Turn/Backstab | Betrayal (Barbershop Window model) creates huge emotional spikes, risks fan sympathy splits |
| Forced Separation | Drafts, contract disputes, booking decrees; feels cold if not emotionally built |
| Mutual Respect Split | Workers agree to pursue solo glory; rare but boosts fan respect for both |
| Poaching/Selling Out | Worker jumps to another faction; viewed as cowardly, greedy, or desperate depending on memory |

**Contract and Loyalty Implications:**

| Situation | Outcome |
|-----------|--------|
| Group Contract Negotiations | Some factions negotiate as blocks ("if you fire X, we all walk"); high-risk if egos split later |
| Star Outgrows Group | Leader or breakout star demands better contract; tension splits factions naturally unless managed |
| Loyalty Shifts Post-Betrayal | Betrayers lose loyalty ratings from old allies; hard to rebuild unless massive redemption arcs |
| Poached Faction Members | Other promotions can target underappreciated midcard faction members, stealing future stars |

---

## TAG TEAM AND FACTION EXPANDED SYSTEMS v2.0 (LOCKED)

**Worker-Led Formation Lobbying:**

| Situation | Chance of Success |
|-----------|------------------|
| Strong Backstage Loyalty or Friendship | Higher chance; promotion sees natural chemistry |
| High Booking Momentum | Promotions more willing to roll with organic alliances if workers are hot |
| Faction Expansion Lobbying | Workers inside factions may lobby to add new members |
| Resistance to Forced Teams | Workers with high Ego, Low Loyalty, or Strong Singles Ambitions resist |

**Freebird Rule (Stable Tag Title Rotation):**

| Layer | How It Works |
|-------|-------------|
| Stable Size | Must be 3+ active members (or configurable) |
| Title Defense Rotation | Any two members (or trio/quad if titles allow) can defend belts |
| Chemistry Bonus/Penalty | Well-oiled groups (Shield, Elite) perform better across combos; dysfunctional stables inconsistent |
| Legacy Boost | Freebird Rule teams remembered as iconic stables if reigns are emotional, dominant, or innovative |

**Tag Split Emotional Memory:**

| Split Storyline | Memory Type |
|-----------------|------------|
| Mentor Jealousy Betrayal (Magnum/Mr. Wrestling 2) | Deep, violent betrayal leaves permanent emotional scars; fans remember forever |
| Tag Division Overstaying | Workers who refuse to split past expiration risk career stagnation memory |
| Cold Contract-Driven Splits | If one leaves for money with no emotional arc, fan memory decays faster |
| Redemption Reunions | Old partners reconcile post-betrayal; emotional memory surges |

**Contract and Negotiation Personality Layers:**

| Worker/Team Type | Behavior |
|------------------|----------|
| Collective Bargainers (Road Warriors, Bucks) | Only negotiate as group unless deep loyalty cracks appear |
| Loose Tag Teams (Singles Wrestlers Together) | Will negotiate separately unless booking convinces them |
| Faction Identity Shifters | Workers who leave trigger rebranding, leader changes, vibe changes (Malakai Black example) |
| Faction Collapsers | When lynchpin leaves, some factions disintegrate unless new leadership emerges |

**Promotion Reaction to Tag and Faction Activity:**

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Supporting Organic Alliances | Boosts booking memory, strengthens roster emotional connections |
| Ignoring Worker Chemistry | Risks backfiring; lost momentum, fan rejection of cold teams/factions |
| Poaching Successful Teams/Factions | AI/players can target established groups to destabilize rivals |

---

## ROAD WARRIORS CASE STUDY: INJURY + INSURANCE SYSTEM (LOCKED)

| Element | What Happened | How We Simulate |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Injury + Insurance Payout | Animal collected Lloyd's of London insurance, legally unable to wrestle | If you take payout, you can't wrestle or breach contract/insurance |
| Tag Team Splintering | Hawk still wanted to wrestle, felt prime slipping | Team members may seek new partners if left inactive too long |
| New Alliance Formation | Hawk built Hell Raisers in NJPW with Kensuke; spiritually connected | "Spiritual Successor" teams based on old identities, especially overseas |
| Faction Identity Drift | "Road Warrior" aura continued in Japan | Spirit of teams can survive geographically even if originals fracture |
| Eventual Reunification | Hawk and Animal reunite in WWF; not at same peak | Redemption/Reunion Memory: Recapture part (but never all) of original magic |

---

## RELATIONSHIP SYSTEM EXPANSION (LOCKED)

**Romantic and Familial Relationships:**

| Relationship Type | Effects |
|-------------------|--------|
| Romantic Partners | Hidden loyalty web; influences booking trust, career decisions, morale. Breakups cause loyalty collapses |
| Familial Ties (Blood, Adopted, Marriage) | Deep emotional loyalty bias unless poisoned by betrayal. Sibling tags, father-son arcs natural |
| Public vs Private Relationships | Some worked into storylines, some private (discovered only if scandals/betrayals occur) |
| Relationship Risk Events | Affairs, divorces, jealousy, cheating scandals can leak (Edge/Lita/Matt Hardy example) |

**Romantic/Family Loyalty vs Friend Loyalty:**
- Tends to be stronger initially
- Breakdowns cause far sharper, emotional collapses
- Fans may react violently if beloved couples or family duos collapse publicly

**Automating Join Dates and Employment Histories:**

| Source | Automation |
|--------|------------|
| Cagematch.net, WrestlingData.com, ProFightDB | Match histories, promotion affiliations, title reigns, career dates, team histories, family |
| Join Date Auto-Generation | First confirmed match = default join date unless manually overridden |
| Employment Timeline | Full employer timeline auto-created, then editable |

**Title Lineage and Worker History Integration:**

| What We Automate | How |
|------------------|-----|
| Title Histories | Based on public lineage data (reigns, defenses, unifications). Editable but prefilled |
| Match Counts vs Opponents | Cagematch-style "wrestled X times against Y" drives chemistry bonuses or rivalries |
| Faction and Stable Histories | If documented historical rosters exist, assign automatically |

**Optional Advanced Editing (Power Users):**

| Editable | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| Override Join Dates | Write worker debuting early/late |
| Override Loyalty Settings | Rig someone as bitter grudge-holder or unshakable hero |
| Override Match Histories | Fantasy matchups or alternate booking histories |
| Custom Relationship Overrides | Add/delete romantic/family bonds for storyline reasons |

---

## RELATIONSHIP TIMELINE TRACKING SYSTEM (LOCKED)

**What We Can Track:**

| Relationship Type | Timeline Feasibility |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Marriages and Divorces | Very trackable (public records, interviews, observer coverage) |
| Factions/Tag Teams/Stable Membership | Strongly trackable by debut matches, storyline formations |
| Friendships (like The Kliq) | Loosely trackable by backstage lore, key booking influence eras |
| Trainer/Protégé Relationships | Trackable loosely by debut periods, first major pushes |
| Feuds and Rivalries (Personal Heat) | Trackable if major fallout events documented |
| Falling Outs | Harder, less documented, but possible by career shifts |

**Precision Handling in Database Building:**

| Data Type | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Clear Date Known | Exact month/year set (marriage certificate, official debut show) |
| Era or Period Known | Set rough start (e.g., mid 1994 = June 1994), allow loyalty drift organically |
| Vague Only | Dynamic "soft loyalty" that builds and decays more flexibly |
| Manual Override Option | Modders can override timelines for absolute control |

**Scott Hall Timeline Example:**

| Relationship/Event | Rough Start | Rough End |
|--------------------|-------------|----------|
| Friendship w/ Curt Hennig | ~1985 (AWA) | Lifelong |
| Training Connection to Dusty Rhodes | 1984-1985 | Mentor role fades late 80s |
| Marriage to Dana Lee Burgio | 1990 | Divorced 1998, remarried 1999, divorced 2001 |
| Kliq Formation | Late 1994 | Broken May 1996 (Curtain Call), friendship survived |
| nWo Formation | May-July 1996 | Unity decays late 1998 (Wolfpac split) |
| DDP Recovery Support | 2012 | Until Hall's death (2022) |

| Company Style Skew (±20%) | Default preference weighting |
| Match Flavour Selection | Booker sets optional flavour emphasis |
| Flavour-Style Compatibility | Check flavour vs company style and match type |
| Worker-Flavour Compatibility | Check worker style vs chosen flavour |
| Fanbase Bias Memory | Promotions build historical taste in fans |
| Media Reporter Bias | Different outlets favor different traits |
| Final Match Rating Adjustment | All factors combined |
