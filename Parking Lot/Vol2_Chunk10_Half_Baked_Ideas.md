## 🍳 THE HALF-BAKED TREASURES

### 1. Beat the Traffic Mentality / Top Star Travel Clause

**Source:** "Some older house shows had the main event before the intermission... so hogan and the top guy(s) can beat traffic"

**Seed:** Worker contracts or ego tags affecting SHOW CONSTRUCTION. Main eventers demanding to go on early so they can leave. Real-world logistics > storytelling purity.

**Potential System:** Worker Contractual Demands affecting card placement. "Early Exit Clause" tag. Ties to backstage politics, ego, seniority, star power leverage.

---

### 2. TV Algorithm Pressure / Analytics-Focused Management

**Source:** "If the promotion has TV Pressure or Analytics-Focused Management, this becomes a stronger AI tendency"

**Seed:** Promotion traits creating pressure to book "hot openers" even when it damages show flow. Network executives, ratings pressure, lead-in audience capture.

**Potential System:** Network Pressure System. Promotions with TV deals face different constraints. Affects creative freedom, segment approval, finish protection requirements, main event placement.

---

### 3. Backstage Fights / Gossip Seeds

**Source:** "Can tie into morale, scandal risk, political intrigue"

**Seed:** Workers having backstage beef that simmers, spreads as gossip, affects booking politics, could explode into shoot incidents or work-shoot angles.

**Potential System:** Backstage Drama Engine. Worker relationships creating political factions, gossip networks, heat that either stays hidden or boils over publicly.

---

### 4. Fan Interactions / PR Events

**Source:** "Meet-and-greets, scandals, media comments, Twitch moments"

**Seed:** Modern era PR layer. Workers' social media presence, public appearances, parasocial relationships, streaming incidents that become headlines.

**Potential System:** Public Relations / Social Media Layer. Workers generate buzz or scandal through non-wrestling activities. Affects popularity, scandal risk, sponsor relationships.

---

### 5. Commentary-Driven Match Perception (ANNOUNCER SYSTEM)

**Source:** "Announcers, skilled ones anyway, can basically highlight this fact by talking about 'this would be a good experience for [young upstart]'"

**Seed:** The SAME match with different commentary lands differently. Announcers can reframe predictable losses as growth experiences.

**Potential System:** Announcer Skill System. Commentators with their own stats: hype ability, storytelling, chemistry, ability to save bad matches, credibility with different fanbases. JR vs Michael Cole vs Kevin Kelly produce different experiences.

**Examples:**
- JR calling underdog match = +emotional investment
- Cole phoning it in = -match heat
- Kevin Kelly's NJPW delivery = +gravitas for puro style
- Excalibur move-calling = +technical crowd satisfaction, -casual engagement

---

### 6. Production Budget Layer

**Source:** "sharkboy at the undersea hospital costing tna thousands for a onetime use lol"

**Seed:** Production budget as a real constraint. Some segments cost real money. One-time set builds, on-location shoots, pyro budgets.

**Potential System:** Segment Production Costs. Promotions have budgets. Indies can't afford Firefly Funhouse. TNA wasting money on Undersea Hospital is comedy AND mechanics.

---

### 7. Regional Gesture Interpretation

**Source:** "Crowd throws coins at matches they hate (or as a sign of overwhelming love in some regions)"

**Seed:** The same physical action having OPPOSITE meanings based on cultural context.

**Potential System:** Gesture Interpretation by Region. Streamers = respect (AJPW) vs banned (NJPW). Silence = respect (Japan) vs death (US). Turning backs = protest vs walkout. Same inputs, different meanings.

---

### 8. Push Rejection Detection

**Source:** "Shota Umino being booed = clear crowd rejection of booking, not heel support"

**Seed:** When fans reject a push so hard they boo a babyface, it's NOT heel heat. It's booking rejection.

**Potential System:** Push Rejection vs Heel Heat distinction. Different causes, different fallout, different fixes. The system knows when fans hate YOUR BOOKING not the character.

---

### 9. Moral History Tracker

**Source:** "Reformed heels carry moral baggage but also emotional depth"

**Seed:** A face turn doesn't wipe the slate clean. Character history colors everything. Eddie Guerrero as face still had "lie cheat steal" DNA.

**Potential System:** Moral Baggage accumulation. Affects promo interpretation, storyline authenticity, what the crowd believes about this character's future actions.

---

### 10. Performance Commitment Layer (PASSIVE RESISTANCE)

**Source:** "Some veterans start refusing to sell the turn or put over a flake"

**Seed:** When booking is bad enough, workers stop trying in-ring. Sandbag, phone it in, make segments look bad on purpose. Passive resistance through minimum effort.

**Potential System:** Worker Commitment to Booking. Workers who hate their booking may still do it but do it BADLY. Affects match quality, promo delivery, segment scores. Different from just morale: active sabotage through minimum effort.

---

### 11. Long-Term Story Potential Tracker

**Source:** "Roman when he turns in 2027 and we cry"

**Seed:** The system could track multi-year story potential. "If Roman turns face in 3-5 years, it will be legendary."

**Potential System:** Deferred Payoff Planning. AI or player flags "this current angle is building toward something years away." The Hangman Arc took years, system should understand that's valuable.

---

### 12. Career Phase Recognition

**Source:** "post-Hangman Omega" mentioned as a specific state

**Seed:** A worker at different career points is essentially a different character. Young Lion vs Ace vs Veteran Tanahashi.

**Potential System:** Career Phase tags affecting booking options and crowd expectations. You can't book "hungry young lion" stories for a 20-year veteran unless doing career reinvention arc.

**Phases:**
- Young Lion / Prospect
- Rising Star
- Upper Card Player
- Ace / Top Guy
- Veteran / Elder Statesman
- Legend on Borrowed Time
- Comeback Attempt
- Career Reinvention

---

### 13. Show Energy Budget

**Source:** "Match pacing and placement affect downstream energy"

**Seed:** Energy isn't per-match, it's cumulative across a show. Hot openers drain crowd for later. Slow builds conserve energy.

**Potential System:** Show Energy Economy. Each segment spends or builds crowd energy. Running out = flat reactions regardless of quality. Rest holds, cool-downs become strategic.

---

### 14. Move Credibility Memory (Deep Version)

**Source:** "some fans will buy nearfalls but not really buy them"

**Seed:** Fans have LEARNED what moves actually end matches. Conditioned pops vs genuine belief.

**Potential System:** Crowd Pattern Recognition. Fans track booking patterns subconsciously. If butterfly piledriver has never won, they pop but don't believe. Goes deeper than Finisher Threat Index into meta-layer of crowd education.

---

### 15. Transcendence Events

**Source:** "naito in 2017 or so was undeniable... gotta be an exception not something easily earned"

**Seed:** Sometimes a worker breaks normal crowd logic rules. Japanese fans typically don't cheer cool heels, but Naito became something else.

**Potential System:** Transcendence logging. Exceptional moments where normal rules don't apply. Rare, not replicable. Affects how future similar attempts are received (cheaper if everyone tries it).

---

### 16. Network Censorship / Standards

**Source:** "Risk backlash, network censorship, scandal triggers" for on-location segments

**Seed:** TV networks have content standards. Some segments get vetoed. Some air but create sponsor problems.

**Potential System:** Network Standards Layer. PG era restrictions, TV-14 limits, premium cable freedom. Affects what segments can air, what finishes are acceptable, what language is permitted.

---

### 17. Worker Shoot Potential

**Source:** Discussion of Pillman's Got a Gun, shoot comments risk

**Seed:** Some workers are one bad day away from going into business for themselves. Shoot promos, legit fights, going off-script.

**Potential System:** Shoot Risk assessment. Workers with certain personality tags (loose cannon, shoot mentality, disgruntled) may deviate from booking. Can be catastrophic or legendary depending on context.

---

### 18. Viral Segment Engine

**Source:** "Segment Goes Viral" mentioned as outcome but not systematized

**Seed:** Modern era segments can break containment and reach mainstream. This is different from just "good buzz."

**Potential System:** Virality mechanics. What makes something spread beyond wrestling fans? Factors: cultural timing, celebrity involvement, outrageous content, emotional resonance, meme potential.

---

### 19. Fake Memory

**Source:** "You can push a moment, but if it didn't land emotionally, fans won't buy it later"

**Seed:** Promotion tries to build history retroactively. "Remember that legendary moment?" But fans don't actually remember it that way.

**Potential System:** Memory Authenticity tracking. Promotions trying to manufacture nostalgia for moments that weren't actually over. Fans see through it.

---

### 20. AI Booker Archetypes

**Source:** Mentioned as a gap: "Ole, Gedo, Vince"

**Seed:** Different bookers have distinct philosophies. Ole protects young talent through losses. Gedo books factions and long-term arcs. Vince loves big men and shock value. Dusty overbooks everything.

**Potential System:** Booker Personality DNA affecting AI booking decisions. Pace preferences, finish protection, talent evaluation bias, tolerance for risk, faction usage, promo style emphasis.

---

## PRIORITY NOTES

These half-baked ideas represent the soul of what makes SCS different. Not just systems tracking numbers, but systems that understand:

- Real-world logistics affect creative decisions
- Workers have agency and can resist (passively or actively)
- Crowds LEARN patterns over time
- The same action means different things in different contexts
- Stories can be planned years in advance
- Commentary shapes perception
- Budget constraints affect art
- Some moments transcend normal rules
- Memory can be real or manufactured

**Development Priority:**
- Tier 1 (MVP adjacent): Announcer System, Show Energy Budget, Career Phases
- Tier 2 (Alpha): Backstage Drama, Production Budget, Network Pressure
- Tier 3 (Beta): Transcendence Events, Fake Memory, Worker Shoot Risk
- Tier 4 (Post-Release): Social Media Layer, AI Booker Archetypes, Deep Pattern Recognition
